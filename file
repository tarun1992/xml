                    <t>In taking up the first item "Report by the Chairperson of the Trade Negotiations Committee and Report by the Director-General", the Chairperson referred to the recent formal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee and an Informal Heads of Delegation meeting on Tuesday, 12 December. Given the extensive discussions on Tuesday, she said that she did not expect a discussion under this item. She invited the Director-General, as Chairperson of the Trade Negotiations Committee, to say a few words.</t>

                                <t>I do not wish to say anything because we just had the TNC. The only reason I asked for the floor is to celebrate again those Members who recently ratified the Fishery Subsidies Agreement. Yesterday, we heard from the UK that they not only ratified but contributed an unexpected GBP 1,000,000 to the Fishery Subsidies Fund, which is fantastic. In addition, Chile ratified, Gambia ratified. Now we just got news that Barbados is on the verge of ratifying. This was news this morning from the Ambassador who stayed up until 2 a.m. to try to push and give us news. I want to recognize that effort and thank them most sincerely and celebrate them. I am looking for more, especially over the holiday. When we come back, I expect a lot of good news.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson said that given the long agenda and the fact that she had reported to the formal TNC and the informal HODs meetings on 12 December on the work underway on a possible MC13 outcome document, she would not repeat her report at this meeting but would simply refer to the report issued in JOB/TNC/122. She invited delegations to use the end-of-year break to also further reflect on this work, so as to be able to resume this process in the New Year in a solution-oriented and pragmatic manner. She counted on everyone's cooperation.</t>

                                <t>It is really a pleasure to be here with you all and to meet you again at this meeting. As you all know, the past work and the amount of effort that has been done by all of you are great toward the success of the outcomes that are going to come out from the WTO and especially from MC13. We are now less than 10 weeks away from MC13, including the break that we are going to have soon, and we urge everyone to continue their efforts to ensure that we are ready for MC13 at the end of February in Abu Dhabi.</t>

                                <t>For the last few months and after I assumed my role as the Chairperson of MC13, we have been in direct contact with many of your Ministers and official delegations to ensure that we start the preparation for MC13. The feedback is very positive. The promises and the encouragement that we have been receiving from the officials are paving the way towards an outcome that we are going to be all proud of.</t>

                                <t>We also tried to host a few Mini-Ministerials. The first was held on 28 November, specifically on agriculture, and the second was on 11 December in close coordination with the Secretariat and H.E. Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and with the Ministers representatives of different groups and the attendance of the rest of the Members listening to the discussions. Our observations are very simple. First of all, most of the Ministers and representatives were reading from their remarks and that is going to stick to the extreme positions that we have been hearing for quite some time. Second, what we have been seeing from those engagements is that everyone is sticking to the process – not the substantial matter and content. I would highly urge everyone to start shifting gears towards the technicalities and the content itself if we really want to have an outcome that will serve the global community.</t>

                                <t>Earlier today, in Dubai, we concluded the COP28 with a huge success – the success from the representatives of your nations. They achieved an outcome that has been negotiated for the last two weeks and has reflected the interests of everyone on a very complex topic that faces humanity nowadays. Whatever we are facing now, it is not as complex as climate change, and I think we can do it together.</t>

                                <t>Another point that I want to highlight is that in the last few months I have been in direct contact and communication with many in the private sector, as part of my job as Minister of State for Foreign Trade and as Minister in charge of Investment before - and the only comments that I keep hearing are – we do not know what the Ministerial meetings are doing. They are saying that they are not even considered in the discussions and outcomes. As governments, we think that we are doing the right thing for the community, the businesses and the private sector. So, we should engage them and hear their views to ensure that we reflect on the growth of global trade and the global businesses we would like to see.</t>

                                <t>So, as we are heading to MC13, I would like to lay out some of the plan for the upcoming few weeks. If there is any need for another Mini-Ministerial, we would host it, but there is no plan for now to host any. The Ministerial meeting will start on 26 February and will end on 29 February. We are not planning to have a Senior Officials meeting for now. We are discussing it with both the Chairperson of the General Council and the Director-General of the WTO, but we are still assessing the best modalities and way forward to ensure that we bring some of the technical discussions forward.</t>

I want you all to know that when we were in the UAE for COP28, he and Ambassador Abdelsalam Mohamed Al Ali and their team went out of their way to make sure we had a real success. It was not easy. It was a huge place with lots going on and I must say that the UAE team was sterling. So that really made us feel good and gives us a lot of hope for how I hope we will operate once we have MC13 on the ground. So, I want to say heartfelt thank you to the Minister, the Ambassador and the entire team of the UAE.</t>

                                <t>As delegations know well, the modalities of a Ministerial Conference are shaped by the membership, in particular, the state of play of work in negotiating groups and in Councils and Committees.

We just had the same call from H.E. Minister Al Zeyoudi urging us to work here in Geneva and all of you, Excellencies, have said that you want to do that. Ambassadors and technical experts have stressed that delivering much of the result and leaving as few square brackets as possible is within your reach. So, I really urge you to do it and until we see what we can do, we will be watching to see how we can shape those modalities.</t>

This will address the questions delegations have posed about Senior Officials' engagement, duration of the Conference and what will be expected of Ministers each day. Circulation of the modalities in early February should provide delegations with enough time to brief capital while allowing the ongoing processes to significantly progress.</t>

                                <t>The Chairperson noted that the Rules of Procedure (Rule 12) for the Ministerial Conference established that "During the course of each regular session a Chairperson and three Vice-Chairpersons shall be elected from among the Members. They shall hold office from the end of that session until the end of the next regular session." She recalled that in July, the General Council had elected the MC13 Chairperson. Regarding the three Vice-Chairpersons, since the Chairperson would come from the Asian region, and in line with customary practice, she had invited the representatives of the other three broad groupings – i.e., Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean (GRULAC); and developed countries – to consult with their constituencies in order to submit the names for the proposed MC13 Vice Chairpersons.</t>

                                <t>Consultations had been conducted by the group coordinators, and further to this process, the Chairperson had sent a communication on 30 November informing all Members of the three proposed names for the appointment of the MC13 Vice-Chairpersons. In the communication, she had also proposed that, if no objections were received, the General Council would elect the proposed Vice-Chairpersons at the present meeting. Following the communication, she had been informed that H.E. Mr. Federico Alfaro Boyd of Panama was no longer in office. Since then, GRULAC had been consulting and she had received a communication nominating H.E. Jorge Rivera Staff, Minister of Trade and Industry of the Republic of Panama, as proposed MC13 Vice-Chairperson. Since there had been no objections with regard to the proposed nominations communicated on 30 November, which had already included Panama, she believed that the General Council was in a position to elect H.E. Mr. Luc Magloire Mbarga Atangana (Cameroon); Hon. Mr. Todd McClay (New Zealand); and H.E. Jorge Rivera Staff (Panama) as MC13 Vice-Chairpersons.</t>

                                <t>In moving to the next sub-item "Request for Observer Status by Palestine", the Chairperson drew the General Council's attention to the request for Observer status at MC13 by Palestine, circulated in WT/L/1171. In accordance with customary practice, she had undertaken consultations, and it was her understanding that Members might be in a position to take action concerning this request. Therefore, she proposed that the General Council agree to grant Palestine Observer Status at MC13 on an ad hoc basis.</t>

                                <t>Following reform discussions on institutional matters, throughout the year, Members have emphasized the need to ensure meaningful Ministerial engagement during Ministerial Conferences. With MC13 fast approaching, there was demand from Members for the General Council Chairperson to establish a roadmap to guide the work in the lead up to MC13. In this regard, you may recall that I circulated in July a road map to MC13, which I further fleshed out following my consultations with Members in November.</t>

                                <t>Members continue to attach high priority to dispute settlement reform. You may recall that, in February 2023, Mr. Marco Molina of Guatemala started convening informal meetings on DS Reform with the objective of having substance-based discussions to find practical solutions to the concerns identified by Members. These discussions have intensified and, as I understand from the DSB Chairperson – Ambassador Ølberg, an agenda item dedicated to this matter will again be taken up at the DSB meeting on Monday, 18 December.</t>

Following Members' request, the General Council continues to monitor progress and coordinate with WTO Bodies as "reform-by-doing" work advances. In this regard, in addition to the reports by respective Chairpersons of WTO Bodies, I asked the Secretariat to continue updating the report in JOB/GC/359 at every regular session of the General Council at least until MC13. An update of the report was circulated prior to the Senior Officials' meeting, and the most recent revision was circulated as JOB/GC/359/Rev.2 on 11 December.</t>

She then recalled that at the March General Council meeting, a common understanding had emerged - namely: the issue of the duration of the deadline will remain on the General Council agenda; that Members will provide an update on where they stand on their internal processes; and that substantive discussions will continue in the TRIPS Council. It was her understanding that Members had continued their discussions on the substance of paragraph 8 of the TRIPS Decision in the TRIPS Council, and that Ambassador Pimchanok Pitfield (Thailand), Chairperson of the Council for TRIPS, would provide an update on these discussions.</t>

To further broaden the basis for fact- and evidence-based discussions, the Council also held a "Thematic Session for External Stakeholder Input" on 28 September 2023, where more than 20 representatives from data analysts, international organizations, civil society, business and academia shared facts, evidence and experiences relevant to the Council's discussions on this issue. The interventions at this thematic session reflected a broad spectrum of views and provided additional detail and analysis on certain elements of this long-running debate. My report on the thematic session has been circulated in document IP/C/W/706. WTO Members were also briefed on the "Report on COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics and TRIPS flexibilities" by the US International Trade Commission on 19 October 2023.</t>

                                <t>Despite this continued and focused engagement on this issue there is currently no consensus among Members on whether to extend the Decision to COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. In my meetings and consultations, Members have largely reiterated their known and diverging positions. A number of Members consider extension long overdue, and are calling for a binary "yes-or-no decision" on this question at this General Council meeting based on the proposed decision text in document IP/C/W/694/Rev.1. Other Members consider that there is no basis for an extension as they see no evidence of IP-related barriers to such products and consider that the pandemic is largely over. Some have suggested that, as consensus on extension is unlikely, Members should agree on a forward-looking work programme on pandemic preparedness so as to continue the discussion on IP in a broader WTO context. In light of these diverging views and suggestions, I stand ready to continue facilitating Members' engagement on this question as appropriate. This concludes my status report on the work under paragraph 8.</t>

                                <t>As you know, the MC12 Decision on this issue instructs the Council for TRIPS to continue its examination of the scope and modalities for such complaints under the TRIPS Agreement, and to make recommendations to MC13. Members agreed that, in the meantime, such complaints would not be initiated under the TRIPS Agreement. Despite my encouragement in the course of my consultations on this issue in November, and the continued discussion at the informal Council meeting in November, a number of Members are not ready to agree on a recommendation on TRIPS non-violation complaints at this stage. On 29 November, I circulated a draft decision as a basis for consideration for Members, in the event that they might wish to recommend to the Ministerial Conference to once again extend the moratorium on such complaints under the TRIPS Agreement. This draft has been circulated in JOB/IP/72 and is closely based on the text of previous such decisions.</t>

                                <t>The WTO has exhibited glaring shortcomings in its inability to take timely, adequate measures to address the needs of developing countries. The arduous one-and-a-half years it took for the WTO to arrive at a narrowly focused decision solely on vaccines is emblematic of its failure. The final Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, adopted on 17 June 2022, falls short of the comprehensive TRIPS waiver proposal championed by 65 developing country Members and supported globally by health experts and members of the public.</t>

                                <t>Paragraph 8 of the Decision states, "No later than six months […] Members will decide on its extension to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics". This paragraph was a major concession by cosponsors who, in good faith, agreed to allow Members the six months they requested to conduct internal consultations. One and a half years later, there is still no decision. The tactics employed by some Members to continually delay the adoption of a decision on the extension are unacceptable. At the TNC on Tuesday, one Ambassador aptly referred to a trust deficit prevailing in the WTO. Certainly, reneging on the commitment in paragraph 8 has damaged trust. The time for delays is over – decisive action is required.</t>

                                <t>The emergence of COVID-19 variants, characterized by an increasing number of mutations, has been confirmed by scientists. The heightened risk is evident in the appearance of new variants, surges in infections, and declining immunity. The challenge of high prices and limited access persists in many developing countries. Despite representing only 16 per cent of the global population, high-income countries acquired more than 70 per cent of therapeutic supplies. It is reported that the number of people with high-risk COVID-19 infections in developing countries exceeded the procured supply of paxlovid recommended by the WHO by at least eight million courses in 2022. This shortfall left unmet at least 90 per cent of the health need for the WHO-preferred treatment in developing countries. Cosponsors, WHO, and other experts have presented evidence on the insufficiency of initiatives such as voluntary licenses, tier-pricing and access schemes of international organizations in facilitating prompt access to COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics in developing countries. Ample facts and evidence have been conveyed to Members questioning the need to extend the waiver decision to therapeutics.</t>

However, one Member had maintained some concerns, deeming the report lacking ambition in certain respects.

Paragraph 8 of the MC12 Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement regarding the extension of the decision to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is unambiguous. Regrettably, we have not been able to deliver on this issue that would better equip developing countries to respond to current and future pandemics. While non-proponents continue to maintain that voluntary licenses are sufficient to address developing countries concerns, we are of the view that though voluntary licenses are pertinent and useful public health tools, they are not adequate in addressing all issues of public health, during global health emergencies.</t>

We did not reverse these adoptions not to stand in the way and change anything. However, we request the General Council to agree that the change in those bodies can be implemented on a trial basis. This is similar to what was already agreed in some of the bodies where it was agreed to apply the e-agenda on a trial basis – a good idea that came from the reform by doing process. We can also test the impact on the LDC Group and LDCs. Finally, while useful in some cases, the "written procedure" and circulating proposals for adoption during summer recess should be avoided. We reiterate our applause to the Secretariat, and the Chairpersons for all of the great work done on several areas of reform of the functioning of the various committees and councils.</t>

We note that in addition to the Council for Trade in Goods, almost all of its 14 subsidiary bodies have undertaken at least one activity to implement paragraph 24 of said Declaration. The work carried out has taught us several lessons relating to what each actor should adopt, at the national and/or international level, in times of crisis. With this in mind, we welcome the concrete results that the Committee on Market Access (CMA) has agreed. We urge other bodies to follow the example of the Market Access Committee in order to also achieve concrete results in their respective areas. Furthermore, we want to reiterate our call to net food exporting Members to refrain from applying export restrictions to LDCs and NFIDCs importing critical products for their domestic health and protection needs.</t>

We reiterate that the WTO has an important role to play in working with relevant international organizations to help LDCs bridge the digital divide in order to strengthen the resilience of their economies and initiate their structural transformation. Finally, as part of the update of the WTO website to reflect actions taken in the context of the implementation of paragraph 24 of the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO response to the COVID-19 pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics, we urge the WTO Secretariat to add at least one link relating to the impact of this pandemic in LDCs.</t>

                                <t>On item 3.A(iii), the LDC Group thanks South Africa for presenting the document. The LDC Group is a co-sponsor of the initiative leading to the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement Waiver on COVID-19 Vaccine during MC12. Our Group calls on Members to continue to engage constructively in order to find consensus by the MC13 to include therapeutic and diagnostic products in said Ministerial Decision. We must learn from our failures, and the same mistakes and procrastination should not be repeated during a pandemic in future. For any global crisis, the LDCs are the worst victims. In this regard, the LDC Group requests to make a favourable decision to extend the MC12 decision on the TRIPS Waiver to cover therapeutics and diagnostics.</t>

                                <t>We note the update on the detailed overview of the work carried out by councils, committees and negotiating bodies with respect to reform by doing. Paragraph 3 of the MC12 Outcome Document commits us to work towards necessary reform of the WTO in a manner which is Member-driven, open, transparent and inclusive. While we especially commend the work being carried out by the Council for Trade in Goods and its subsidiary bodies, we note that many developing Members with capacity constrained delegations, including CARICOM Members, have not been able to actively participate in much of this reform work. We view many of the improvements being introduced to be useful. However, we need to strike the right balance in terms of ensuring that there is a sufficient level of inclusivity in this work. We also have to ensure that some reforms which are meant to bring about improvements, do not have the unintended effect of imposing additional burdens on developing countries and LDCs. In this regard, it is important to retain the reporting arrangements to the General Council and we trust that Members will maintain a sufficient level of flexibility to allow a developing Member to comment on or propose any amendment to a particular reform measure.</t>

The CARICOM Group recognizes that the issue has been discussed both in the formal and informal working groups of the TRIPS Council and the SOM this year, yet there has been limited progress. We note that this issue remains important as a decision on Paragraph 8 will provide more legal certainty for Governments and legitimate policy space to adequately respond to health emergencies, and we wish to urge necessary and requisite action.</t>

                                <t>We wish to make a caution and a suggestion. We caution against the introduction of reforms or improvements which on the surface, may appear to be making a qualitative difference, but which in actuality, impacts negatively on Members with small delegations. Here, we mention the change in the number of days before an agenda is closed. On one hand, it does objectively allow for Members to have better sight of an agenda which could go a far way in aiding preparations for a meeting, including consultations with capitals and stakeholders. However, on the other hand, it also reduces the time that a capacity constrained delegation has to introduce an item on an agenda. This leads to our suggestion, which is that these reforms should be reviewed periodically so as to assess their impacts and where necessary, make appropriate modifications.</t>

On reform, let me welcome the efforts of the Secretariat and all the efforts that we, the Members have put into institutional reform. As you know, the UK (and 55 Members) presented a paper to this Committee on this very important issue. We talk about showing progress, since MC12, we can be proud of the work we have done as an organization, and it shows how much we can achieve if we just get on with it. Look at the work of the CTG, just one example, 120 reforms across that Committee. At the heart of that, ensuring that we build trust, and that we ensure even the very smallest delegation here can engage in our work in a way that is constructive.</t>

                                <t>On the pandemic response and TRIPS, we have done some really important work on the pandemic response, following on the statement from MC12, which obviously needs to continue. On TRIPS it is clear, that the reality, despite all the discussions we have had, there is no consensus amongst Members on whether or not the extension on therapeutics and diagnostics is genuinely required. It is also true that the MC12 decision, which we spent so much time elaborating, has not been used. We need to think carefully about the value of extending something that does not appear to help all that much as we had hoped on the ground. So, without understanding the consequences of extending that decision we risk compromising the very international IP system that we have worked so effectively to develop, and has been, in our view, been so useful to us in that pandemic response.</t>

We recognize that voluntary licences are not a silver bullet, as is clear in the Annexes to our papers, but there are clear examples of their successful use.

We need to find workable solutions to key negotiations for MC13, such as dispute settlement reform, agriculture, and fisheries subsidies.

                                <t>On the WTO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Union welcomes the work undertaken in the subsidiary bodies of the CTG on experience-sharing relating to the trade challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that this type of technical work was not only useful to help identify solutions and best practices during the pandemic itself but can serve as a model for future pandemics and similar trade-disruptive events. We especially welcome the outcome document agreed upon in the Committee on Market Access, which attempts to draw conclusions and provides a useful summary of the work done. We welcome that the report endorses and highlights these conclusions. On TRIPS, while the European Union is ready to engage in the discussions on whether to extend the scope of the Ministerial Decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics, we note that little progress has been made in this complex discussion and the positions of Members remain far apart. It is clear to us that there is no consensus on this issue among the Members. The European Union remains ready to engage constructively and therefore considers that the discussion should continue in order to find a consensual solution.</t>

We thank you for your report and for the state of play report on WTO reform contained in the document JOB/GC/359/Rev.2 regarding the work improvement in WTO councils and committees. We welcome the improvements. The core objective of WTO institutional reform is to improve its work and not to create new difficulties. Moreover, any reform must not lead to an alteration of the multilateral and Member-driven character of the WTO. All reform proposals and their finalization must be consolidated in the General Council.</t>

                                <t>In the Senior Officials' Meeting in October, senior officials from Bangladesh and majority of Members strongly expressed support for a two-tier DS system. The senior officials also reiterated the need to bring the so-called delegate-led informal discussions as soon as possible under a relevant WTO body. It is a pity that despite clear instructions by the Ministers in MC12 outcome document paragraph 4, till date no WTO body has initiated any discussion on DS reform. Members can legitimately provide suggestions or express concerns only through a relevant WTO body. Therefore, it's urgent to bring the DS reform discussion under a relevant WTO body, respecting the agreed and established procedures of decision making in WTO.</t>

                                <t>Regarding paragraph 8 of the Ministerial decision on TRIPS Waiver, Bangladesh aligns with the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf of the Cosponsors of IP/C/W/669/Rev.1 and the statement delivered by Djibouti on behalf of the LDC Group. We are disappointed that Members could not agree within the deadline to follow the good gesture of the Ministers. Enough facts and evidence were provided by the co-sponsors. Future pandemic is a threat. We must learn from our failures as WTO could not address the supply constraints of necessary COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics in a timely manner. The same mistakes and procrastination should not be repeated in future. Bangladesh supports that the MC12 decision on TRIPS Waiver should be extended to cover therapeutics and diagnostic, as soon as possible, as proposed in the draft decision WT/GC/W/913, as presented by South Africa on behalf of the co-sponsors.</t>

                                <t>On item 3.A(i) related to WTO reform, having a fully functioning dispute settlement system is Malaysia's top reform priority. As we reiterated in numerous occasions, a fully functioning of the two-tier dispute settlement system is fundamental to this Organization and must remain as the central pillar of this institution. In this regard, Malaysia is glad to engage in the ongoing process, and we welcome the informal discussions on the dispute settlement reform, with a view to restore and making the dispute settlement system operational again. However, we wish to highlight that participation in these discussions is not without its challenges to small delegations, like Malaysia. In order to safeguard the interests of all Members, with a particular emphasis on developing and least-developed countries, it is imperative that this process is carried out in a manner that embodies inclusivity and transparency.</t>

                                <t>With regard to item 3.A(iii) on extending the TRIPS Decision to COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics, Malaysia acknowledges the importance of adopting an evidence-based approach to illustrate that intellectual property rights do not obstruct access or supply of these products. Hence, Malaysia is of the view that some related reports, including by the USITC are crucial to support the ongoing discussion at the WTO. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for equitable access to affordable diagnostics and therapeutics globally. Hence, Malaysia hopes that a consensus that strikes a balance between public health needs and concerns related to intellectual property rights, can be reached at MC13 by fostering constructive dialogue and intensifying evidence-based engagement.</t>

These improvements, requested and pursued by Members to ensure better, more effective participation, therefore constitute significant work. The effective functioning of the regular bodies is necessary to continue and improve the monitoring and implementation function of the Agreements in force and their successful application.</t>

We believe that the CTG has adopted exemplary improvements, and we would like to call on all WTO Councils to assess the best practices adopted by the CTG, with a view to replicating and adopting them, where feasible. The Committee on Trade and Environment is also working on some improvements and held its first thematic session this year within the framework of the "reform by doing". Regarding formal procedural improvements, my delegation has already submitted specific proposals, which, as agreed, will continue to be analyzed with a view to their implementation under the Chair's excellent stewardship.

                                <t>On paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, I express my thanks to the TRIPS Council Chair for her report and to the delegation of South Africa for its proposal. Paraguay wishes to express its support for document WT/GC/W/913, which proposes to extend the waiver to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics. For countries like Paraguay, i.e., net importers of medical products and equipment with a limited capacity for local production, it is crucial to have a proper international supply chain. This includes COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, medical equipment, materials and diagnostic methods. It is essential that markets remain open without unnecessary distortions and that there be greater transparency regarding prices and conditions. We also support the strengthening of trade facilitation measures for such products with a view to reducing the restrictions imposed by producer Members, as the most vulnerable suffer most. I would like to stress that this is not simply a trade issue but also has a direct impact on our citizens' health. Paraguay therefore wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement adopted at MC12 and support the extension to therapeutics and diagnostics. We urge Members to reach a consensus on this issue as soon as possible.</t>

                                <t>I will address agenda items 3.A(i) and 3.A(ii). First, my delegation would like to thank you for your reports on "reform by doing" and the WTO response to the pandemic. Ecuador believes that the report on reform ought to have included the work of the Committee on Trade and Environment on "reform by doing". I would like to highlight a significant milestone in this regard. The Committee has launched the Organization of thematic sessions on a trial basis; the first thematic session focused on trade contributions to energy transition efforts concerning climate change adaptation and mitigation. This session was held on 13 November. Members have had a positive view since the first meeting and have evaluated their results with a view to adjusting the future working methodology.  We hope to hold two additional thematic sessions next year.</t>

                                <t>Regarding "reform by doing", we welcome the fact that, in the Goods Council and its subsidiary bodies, 127 measures have been implemented that have contributed significantly to improving the work of delegations in Geneva and our capitals. We thank you for your report, Madam Chair, which includes these improvements. This will have a positive impact on the deliberative function of the Organization. From our perspective, the harmonization of procedures and the publication and distribution of information, as well as the e-Delegates portal, among other measures, are of particular benefit to small delegations with limited human resources. We are all aware that this is not a simple task, and countless meetings have been held this year making it possible to achieve these results. In this regard, Ecuador wishes to recognize the constructive participation of all delegations, particularly Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay, with whom my delegation has worked in a close and coordinated fashion.</t>

This step-by-step approach is indeed useful in consolidating the WTO as a forum for international dialogue.</t>

                                <t>Regarding item 3.A(iii), let me thank the TRIPS Council Chairperson for her report. My delegation takes note of communication WT/GC/W/913. We recall that WHO declared last May the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as a health emergency. More than a year ago Mexico and Switzerland submitted facts and figures in communication IP/C/W/693, which demonstrate that COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics are sufficiently available globally and that access is not blocked by IP. These trends have since been confirmed, including by the facts and data presented at the thematic session, that there is a surplus both in products and manufacturing capacity for COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Millions of COVID-19 vaccines doses, therapeutics and diagnostics have had to be destroyed since due to reaching expiry date. As just mentioned by the UK, the MC12 TRIPS Decision on COVID-19 vaccines has not been used. An extension of this Decision to therapeutics and diagnostics is not necessary nor useful and risks to be counterproductive. In sum, there is no consensus among Members to take a decision on paragraph 8 extension, and the General Council should take note of this.</t>

If there are issues with efforts that are lacking in terms of reform by doing, we need to engage with each other in a conversation and maybe we are able to do this at the General Council.</t>

COVID-19 pandemic impacted every facet of human, and vulnerable developing countries and LDCs are still reeling under the inflation and debt engendered partly by the global policies followed after COVID-19. We believe that WTO's response future pandemics must facilitate the strengthening of the resilience of our economies and our state of preparedness. To this end, we urge Member's attention to the submission made by Pakistan that calls for flexibilities for those vulnerable developing countries that face crisis situations including balance-of-payment issues, pandemics and natural disasters.</t>

We can neither ignore the threat of future pandemics nor the necessity of affordable and timely access to diagnostics and therapeutics. Pakistan aligns with the statement made by the distinguished Ambassador of South Africa, on behalf of the co-sponsors of IP/C/W/669/Rev.1 and urges the General Council to immediately extend the Decision adopted by the Ministers by consensus after long protracted negotiations at MC12, to therapeutics and diagnostics.</t>

                                <t>Regarding paragraph 8 of the Ministerial decision on the TRIPS Agreement, my delegation wishes to thank South Africa and co-sponsors for the statement. Sri Lanka also wishes to align with many Members who proposed the extension of 17 June 2022 Ministerial Decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics. As we know, markets failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic that had an impact on the majority of the people on this earth. The main reason was the constraints of supply side of the market. If we had a stronger supply side, not only for vaccines, but also for therapeutic and diagnostics, we could have avoided many catastrophic situations in many developing countries and LDCs. Therefore, the extension is important not only for economic reasons of correcting the market forces, but also for moral reasons.</t>

                                <t>Let me respond to the agenda item 3.A(i) and 3.A(iii). We appreciate your update on the state-of-play of WTO reform. Like many others in this room, my delegation wants to see the WTO that is fit-for-purpose, fit-for-its time, and caters to the needs and interests of its diverse membership. My delegation attaches great importance, among others, on measures to facilitate Members' effective participation in WTO bodies. This includes allowing ample of preparatory time for Members to participate in the meeting. I welcome progress in the right direction, for instance, in recent Committee on Agriculture Regular Session, whereas Members approved to advance the timelines for the release of the reminder airgram and the closure of agenda. I also wish to underline the need to avoid scheduling conflicts, especially between meetings that attract great deal of interests from Members. A case in point is yesterday's session of the General Council that coincided with the Secretariat's logistical briefing for the MC13.</t>

                                <t>Moving to agenda item 3.A(iii), Indonesia would like to align its statement with South Africa, on behalf of the IP/C/W/669/Rev.1 co-sponsors. Despite evidence and facts showing that COVID-19 is here to stay, it is inexplicable that we keep hearing a much louder cry for more "evidence" or "facts" to reach a decision on this issue. Indeed, we cannot apologize to the dead, particularly to the 7 million people whose live tragically ended by COVID-19 – many of them are friends and families of ourselves. However, we can rectify our past mistakes through immediately extending the 17 June TRIPS Decision adopted by the Ministers by consensus after long protracted negotiations, mutatis mutandis to therapeutics and diagnostics, as requested by proponents in document WT/GC/W/913. Our action, or inaction, will be judged by our future generations. Therefore, it is my hope that this organization is able to show that we care about protecting public's health and to be united for common good.</t>

                                <t>Regarding paragraph 8 of the MC12 decision, we endorse the statement made by the distinguished delegation of South Africa on behalf of the co-sponsors of document IP/C/W/669/Rev.1. We regret that, more than one and a half years later, no concrete progress has been made in fulfilling the mandate adopted by Ministers at MC12 to extend the waiver decision to therapeutics and diagnostics, as indicated in paragraph 8 of the decision. The high cost of essential medical supplies to combat COVID-19 became evident during the pandemic, and many countries face major challenges in accessing medicines and diagnostic tests, the procedures for which are costly, complex, and lengthy. Several states encourage the use of voluntary licensing, but Bolivia made a request in this regard, and to date, we have heard nothing, which clearly shows how voluntary licensing does not offer an opportunity to provide the rapid response required in a health emergency.</t>

                                <t>Accordingly, we believe that it is crucial to continue the discussions to conclude the implementation of the decision. It is clear that the international community's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was, for many populations worldwide, belated and limited. The pandemic and its effects remain latent, and one of the lessons learned is that to react to future pandemics, the limited access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics must be addressed. We must prioritize human life and those hit hardest by the adverse effects of this and future pandemics.</t>

During the ongoing discussions, we have learned that there are various contributing factors beyond IP in ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics. We also recognize the necessity to further explore broader approaches, such as voluntary licensing and technology transfer, including issues of geographical limits and sandwich countries. A consensus among Members has not been reached yet beyond the deadline. However, Korea believes this should not lead to the end of the discussion.</t>

India would like to echo the views of co-sponsors who spoke before me and align ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of co-sponsors. It is regrettable that a decision remains elusive for this multilateral body on such a critical issue of global significance. Despite protracted deliberations over three years, we have disappointed ourselves and we have disappointed the world that was anticipating a quick multilateral response from the organization and during a pandemic. Several rounds of submissions have been made on this issue, so we have not left any stone unturned in responding to all questions raised and clarification sought by Members and through extensive discussions, we presented facts and evidence to guide us in making a decision. I urge all Members to engage with good faith and conclude our discussion today by taking a decision. We hope we all are able to agree for the extension of the MC12 decision to therapeutics and diagnostics as presented in the document IP/C/W/694/Rev.1.</t>

There is a need for continuing this process of incremental reform. Several suggestions by Members are in the pipeline's while a number of short-term implementation suggestions from India through our proposal WT/GC/W/874 dubbed as 30 for 30 have been implemented.

                                <t>We would also like to thank and welcome the report G/L/1523. We are delighted that the CTG and its 14 subsidiary bodies have implemented 127 improvements. My delegation has been engaged deeply and constructively in this exercise. While our paper envisages 30 improvements to the WTO before it completes 30 years, I believe we should up these and replicate the CTG successes elsewhere to make it 300 for 30!</t>

                                <t>The last item which is response to pandemic. On all these three items, I will submit the written statement since time is over. I will just highlight two submissions which we made on response to pandemic that is WT/GC/W/866 and WT/GC/W/867 relating to "role of telemedicine services" and another on "building a pool of health professionals to respond to pandemic and natural disasters" respectively. We look forward to further discussions both at the GC and at the Council for Trade in Services to analyze lessons that have been learned and challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. I look forward to these important discussions being reported to MC13 and seek further guidance from Ministers at the MC13 to continue future work on these two proposals. Lastly, on India's paper in CTG relating to response to pandemic, we would like to say that though it was not part of any notification obligation, but it was an effort on our part to explain the multifaceted response to the pandemic and the key role played by India's trade related government institutions in the response to pandemic.</t>

                                <t>Just two quick comments on two aspects. One is on reform by doing, I want to congratulate Members on the work that they are doing. It is very challenging, and I am sure no matter the effort put in there will always be gaps. We have tried from the Secretariat to be as innovative as we can, and I am glad that Ecuador referred to the e-Delegates platform that we have put together, as well as e-agenda and others. We continue to try to come up with ways to make it easier, especially for small delegations to engage, within the resources that we have. This morning we had a staff recognition day where we recognized some of those who have come up with these innovations, amongst staff.</t>

                                <t>For the LDCs, we are very sympathetic about the limited resources. Just some advice it may be important for some smaller delegations to pull resources because I see that with the MC13 negotiations coming, there is just no way. It is like what I said the other day, we need a lot of meetings to negotiate but these meetings are challenging for small delegations because you want to participate in all. Pulling resources like the Pacific Islands Forum has done could be very helpful to smaller delegations because then a number of countries are represented, or the OECS. This is just a suggestion. I have been trying to get some of the leaders to understand the enormous amount of work here at the WTO for their delegations and some have promised to beef up their missions with some additional help but not all can do it. So, we have to find also other ways or means for least-developed country Members to try to get the work done.</t>

                                <t>On the TRIPS waiver, I strongly want to urge that I hope the membership can come to some decision on this particular issue and not allow it to trail in our books. Bolivia said something important, it was about voluntary licensing, it has not been able to move forward. I hope that the private – all those that have the private sector actors - can move on this particular aspect, if it is to be a tool. But multiple tools are needed. Whilst all this is happening, it is important to say that some Members have moved ahead to change the legislation to enable them to be able to work. For instance, Senegal is moving ahead with a whole supply chain on several types of vaccines, so whilst some are talking others are doing. I strongly also want to urge developing country Members to move quickly on their legislation. We are working with 16 countries now, the WHO, WIPO and the WTO, to help them assess their legislative capabilities to use the flexibilities and to fix it. I just wanted to urge Members to take a look at this and let us know if it is something that the tripartite agreement can help you with.</t>

                                <t>Since my last report in November (JOB/GC/368), we have held two dedicated discussions. The Dedicated Discussion on 14 November was the third meeting of the year to focus on the moratorium. Given the calls for more engagement on this issue and for evidence-based analysis, I invited the WTO Secretariat to present the findings of the report on Digital Trade for Development jointly prepared with the IMF, OECD, UNCTAD, and the World Bank. Representatives of the respective organizations attended the meeting and answered Members' questions including on two recent papers issued by the IMF and OECD. The Joint Report had not yet been launched at the time of the meeting. It has since then been officially launched during the e-Week of UNCTAD and is now accessible on the WTO website.</t>

                                <t>At the Dedicated Discussion held on Friday, 8 December, Members started consideration of text-based proposals for a draft Ministerial decision. Three submissions were considered in this regard. Two of them are on the agenda of today's meeting (WT/GC/W/909 from Canada, Switzerland and other co-sponsors, and WT/GC/W/911 from South Africa). A third one, from the ACP Group, was made available in the room and subsequently circulated in WT/GC/W/916. All three draft documents call for the continued re-invigoration of the Work Programme in line with the 1998 mandate. Some contain additional elements, such as emphasis on the development dimension and the reporting process on the work programme to the General Council and/or other relevant bodies and the timings thereof. There were equally proposals for the creation of a trust fund and suggestions for the development of a more level playing field. With respect to the moratorium, two of the draft documents call for the extension of the moratorium until MC14 and one calls for its termination at MC13.</t>

                                <t>Since the three draft documents presented at the meeting bear a number of similar elements, these commonalities emerged during discussions, for example, with respect to acknowledging progress made in the reinvigoration of the Work Programme; upholding the development dimension of the work programme; the need to continue working with other IGOs to address identified challenges and deepening discussions on certain issues.</t>

As our discussions on thematic issues have concluded, we have not been able to consider them in the Dedicated Discussions. Whilst I remain guided by Members as to whether there should be special sessions to discuss these papers at a later point, I did inform Members at our meeting last Friday, that they are free to propose language for a Ministerial decision based on their perspectives. Should there be anything specific in these papers that the proponents would wish to see reflected in a potential draft ministerial decision, they are welcome to propose any specific textual language.</t>

                                <t>The concentration of market power, particularly by global tech giants, is resulting in uneven participation in global commerce, notably hindering the growth of Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) and digital start-ups. Our delegation views the Electronic Transmissions (ET) moratorium as one of the significant factors exacerbating these disparities. This moratorium has been in place for a quarter of a century. There is no consensus on this issue.</t>

                                <t>We acknowledge the recent study jointly published by the WTO Secretariat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and the World Bank. While the study primarily emphasizes revenue losses, we wish to underscore that our core concern, articulated consistently by South Africa and others, is the erosion of policy space to employ tariffs as a tool for industrial development. This central challenge has not yet been met with credible responses from the proponents of the moratorium.</t>

Before inviting the respective delegations to introduce the communications, she recalled that, as heard from Ambassador Dwarka-Canabady, these draft decisions had been discussed extensively at the Dedicated Discussion held on 8 December. She reminded delegations that the Dedicated Discussions were held under the auspices of the General Council and that there were minutes for those meetings.  In light of the extensive agenda and to ensure an efficient use of time, she encouraged delegations to avoid duplication of discussions on this item and to intervene only if they had something new to add. She then invited Switzerland to introduce communication WT/GC/W/909.</t>

                                <t>On the e-commerce moratorium, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of not applying customs duties. Indeed, just last week another study by the IMF, OECD, UNCTAD, World Bank and WTO on "Digital Trade and Development" was released.</t>

                                <t>The bottom line coming out of the vast majority of these studies is that not applying customs duties benefits businesses in all member countries, LDCs, developing, and developed, particularly for micro, small, medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which are the lifeblood of the global economy.</t>

Legislation must match the development needs and e-readiness goals of each member. We need not only digital trade, we must have targeted assistance, investment, and cooperation.</t>

                                <t>Our submission also takes up the question of the moratorium. We looked into the antecedents of the treatment of software while in the carrier medium and treatment of content for tariff purposes, other products that were traded in carrier media, to later transform by virtue of the technology into digital form. In the reinvigoration of the work program, it will help developing countries and LDCs to adapt to the transformation and proper analysis be prepared to compare what we were actually doing during this transformation, rather than relying on estimates or predictions. In addressing revenue gain for governments, we must also balance our evaluation to consider the impact on our consumers and businesses, especially small medium sized businesses, and the enterprises of women and youth.</t>

With regards to the moratorium, we found the discussions and experience sharing sessions useful. However, more needs to be done in terms of assessing the revenue loss implications to developing countries and LDCs by maintaining the moratorium. The lapse of the moratorium will give countries the liberty of choice to charge or not the customs duties on certain electronic transmissions, hence its effect to ecommerce will be minute.</t>

Looking ahead of MC13, we thank the joint proponents of WT/GC/W/909 and South Africa and the ACP Group for the circulation of the respective proposals on the drafts of Ministerial Declaration on Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. From our perspective, as ever we should aim at making the moratorium permanent or at least extend the moratorium at MC13, as well as continue discussion in the Work Programme under the Dedicated Discussion format. For this reason, even though Japan is not the proponent, we can positively consider the proposal of WT/GC/W/909. We also appreciate the ACP Group's submission of a constructive proposal toward MC13. Looking at emerging support for extension, we hope we should decide its extension toward MC13 in light of this recognition of the emerging support.</t>

Hence, we call for collective efforts to address the current digital trade imbalances and set a definitive end to the moratorium.

We also would like to highlight that the development dimension of the debate of key e-commerce has been very well, and we appreciate that very much. Thailand would like to also thank South Africa for presenting WT/GC/W/910, which highlights the challenges and difficulties to promote competition and enhance digital industrialization. From their experience, there are some elements in the paper that we are very interested to continue the discussion on the issues that South Africa have highlighted. We also would like to thank Samoa, on behalf of the ACP, for WT/GC/W/916.</t>

We see the commonalities in these proposals, and we hope that they will contribute to the discussion in the work programme. Needless to say, this is an important issue for many Members – developing, developed, LDCs. We hope that Members will not only continue to deep dive the discussion, but also come to a decision on the moratorium.</t>

                                <t>For Thailand, our position is that this is one of the low hanging fruits, which can be concluded before MC13. But frankly, I am not very hopeful that will happen before MC13. But from our point of view, we see that the benefits of maintaining current practice and the continuation of e-commerce moratorium until MC14. So that is our position for the moment.</t>

                                <t>I would like to start by putting on record my delegation's appreciation to the Facilitator for her able leadership in advancing discussions on the Work Programme on E-Commerce (WPEC).

                                <t>First, Singapore is pleased to co-sponsor the draft Ministerial Decision (WT/GC/W/909) to continue the Work Programme on E-Commerce and extend the Moratorium on Customs Duties on E-Commerce. We urge Members to join this emerging consensus as co-sponsors, and to accelerate efforts to reach agreement on a Ministerial Decision early, rather than leaving it to the eleventh hour at MC13.</t>

                                <t>Second, Singapore welcomes the rejuvenated discussions at the WPEC Dedicated Sessions since MC12, which is in line with Ministers' instructions. Like other Members, Singapore has actively contributed by sharing our experiences through five presentations that deal with a range of issues such as (a) our new overseas vendor registration system; (b) the Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs); and (c) trade digitalization. We appreciate the active engagement by Members and hope that these experience-sharing sessions have helped to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas and fostered deeper understanding of these important topics.</t>

                                <t>Third, we must avoid politicizing the Moratorium and engage in more evidence-based discussions. Several useful studies on this issue have been issued, including the joint international organization report on "Digital Trade and Development" launched last week. The report highlighted that the moratorium's impact on government revenue is estimated to be very small (below 0.33 per cent of overall government revenue on average), and that value added taxes are viable alternative policy tools. While there will no doubt continue to be divergence of views over issues such as the scope and definition of electronic transmissions, we hope that the latest evidence-based studies can help to bridge such gaps. We further encourage bringing external stakeholders, such as private sector players, to complement our discussions.</t>

                                <t>In our delegation's view, the moratorium plays a significant role in the increasing digitalization of cross-border trade. Based on our discussions, Chile has reached the conclusion that there is ample evidence confirming the importance of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions, as the moratorium benefits businesses, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which drive the global economy and require greater certainty for their business plans. Therefore, we hope, as others have said before us, that we can have a decision on the moratorium as soon as possible.</t>

                                <t>I would like to thank the Facilitator for her report and her leadership and efforts in this area. For Costa Rica, it is essential that the moratorium on electronic transmissions be maintained and become a permanent decision as soon as possible so that trade actors, particularly those from developing countries, LDCs and MSMEs, have security and predictability regarding the conditions they currently enjoy. Evidence shows that the alleged loss of tax revenue due to the moratorium is either non-existent or completely marginal when compared to its benefits to competitiveness, economic growth, technology transfer, the bridging of the digital divide and development. Lifting the moratorium would lead to less competitiveness and increased costs, which would affect developing countries in particular, widen the digital divide and impact negatively on MSMEs.</t>

                                <t>On the moratorium, we believe that the scope and the definition need to be clarified so Members can understand the scope of their commitment. Hitherto, it has remained ambiguous, and WTO Members have conflicting interpretation of these issues. However, given that achieving consensus on this issue is unlikely at MC13 due to time constraint, it should be accorded priority and taken up post MC13. Regarding the moratorium on Imposing Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions, Nigeria believes it should be extended temporarily at MC13. Nigeria holds this view for three important reasons. First, the non-renewal of the moratorium would undermine the predictability of global e-commerce environment, and this would negatively affect businesses and consumers. Next, it will undermine the competitiveness and growth of our MSMEs who would be unable to access intermediate content at cheaper price. Third, given the dynamic effects of the moratorium, we believe the benefits outweigh the cost and non-renewal will only mean the WTO has chosen not to be responsive to the economic realities of the 21st century.</t>

                                <t>On the moratorium, HKC's position is well known. I would just like to raise two red flags. First, if the moratorium were to lapse at MC13, this would be seen as a retrogression of the WTO in its mission to pursue progressive trade liberalization. This would also run against commercial realities and aspirations of the international business sector, including MSMEs.</t>

                                <t>Imagine who would be more vulnerable if the moratorium were to lapse and Members were at liberty to levy custom duties on electronic transmission. It would be the MSMEs in developing countries and LDCs that would be hard hit, and not the multinational giants in developed countries.</t>

                                <t>I would like to thank Switzerland for introducing the draft Ministerial Decision of WT/GC/W/909, of which we are one of the co-sponsors. We believe that this proposal is a more balanced one. It recommends the continuation of the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions until the 14th Ministerial Conference. It leaves Members with the opportunity to continue periodically reviewing the moratorium. The proposal also upholds the development dimension in the Work Programme to help reduce the digital gap among Members. We urge Members which are yet to join the initiative to support the proposal. I also thank South Africa for introducing its proposals. However, we would like to raise our concern about the WT/GC/W/911 regarding the suggestion of terminating the moratorium.</t>

                                <t>The complex nature of the global digital ecosystem is obvious in that all stakeholders of the e-commerce platforms, the content suppliers and the e-commerce consumers are interconnected. Imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions in the whole ecosystem will be invariably impacted, regardless of their business size. The suggested text in WT/GC/W/911 about terminating the moratorium not only gives rise to serious uncertainty to international trade in e-commerce, but most importantly, poses immense adverse impacts on related sectors and consumers in all Members, particularly those in the more vulnerable Members. It will undermine MSMEs' economic positions most seriously. It is because that, given their limited resources to adapt to drastic changes in the digital trade environment, MSMEs are most vulnerable to any imposition of duties on e-commerce transactions on which they heavily rely.</t>

                                <t>The current global landscape of e- commerce is dominated by a few firms based in developed countries, and most developing countries are net importers of digital products. Increasing participation of developing countries in global e- commerce continues to be a challenge due to the digital divide that exists between the developed and the developing countries. At various international fora concerns have been expressed about the increasing influence of big tech firms, which is counter to the narrative that we hear in this room. MSMEs face considerable challenges on account of anti-competitive business practices of the big tech firms, which had been clearly brought out in the South African submission. Very recently we have seen that in one of the judgments of the authorities in a developed country in the discussion around the moratorium, we believe that the agenda of big tech, I repeat, that we believe that the agenda of big tech is being pursued in the garb of MSMEs. We have never got information that how much of gain in the demanding countries are going to MSMEs and to the big tech firms respectively-that evidence has not been put on table.</t>

We have not yet seen convincing evidence by the proponents of the moratorium, that its continuation has benefited countries particularly developing and LDCs having large population and marketplace. Customs duties have traditionally been used to confer level playing field to domestic industries and also to work on macroeconomic policies for controlling unhindered imported goods influence in case of currency crisis. India believes that while digital industrialization holds the promise for economic development and prosperity for the developing countries, including the LDCs all policy tools in the toolbox, which includes customs duties are needed to realize its full potential.</t>

We support continuing discussions in the Work Programme on trade-related topics to allow developing countries and LDCs to better engage and benefit from e-commerce and the digital economy. On the e-commerce moratorium for Australia, it is a clear, that there is a growing consensus among Members that one of the most damaging things at MC13 could be to let the moratorium lapse. We therefore must see it renewed, ideally before the Conference.</t>

The debate we listened to today, even though there are still some tough positions shows that Members have worked really hard under her leadership and have tried to listen to each other. Perhaps this will lead us to some agreeable solution or compromise - that all can accept. There is a noticeable change in the tone and discussion of what is being said.</t>

                                <t>I wanted to add on top of that, Fiji mentioned the digital divide and the need for developing countries being supported to bridge this divide. I mentioned earlier there is an ongoing programme to do that. We started in Africa with the World Bank that wants to invest in developing countries to do hardware, and we will work with them on software. We had a meeting. They wanted to start in African region. We have asked African countries that wanted to participate to volunteer. We have some countries – Kenya, Rwanda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and Mauritius – who have all volunteered to be part of this. As we speak, DDG Zhang is not here, he is on mission with the World Bank in Rwanda, followed by Benin and Cote d'Ivoire, on this work. Sometimes action is important. I hope, from where we are in Africa, we can move to Latin America, the Pacific and all over the world, if this programme succeeds. So, there is some hope for developing countries that are trying to bridge the digital divide, and whatever decision is made they will be able to benefit because they will have the appropriate infrastructure when this is done.</t>

                                <t>It seems the credibility of the Organization, which is on the edge, is not a concern for many who continue to stonewall permanent solutions to the PSH. In this regard, we wish to mention two points.</t>

                                <t>First, one is the clear message our Senior Official delivered in the SOM. (i) We would like to put on record the Facilitator report on agriculture, particularly paragraph 3 thereof. We hope the Members who object to achieving the Permanent Solution to PSH as per the mandate realise that they are primarily responsible for not achieving any meaningful reforms in agriculture. The harder they resist the permanent solution to PSH, the longer it will take to initiate the rest of the agriculture reforms.</t>

                                <t>(ii) We also heard a number of delegates speak on the food security decision or package. We want to make it very clear that we would not like to have something like in the past Ministerials where we have declarations and decisions, but it does not add a single grain to vulnerable populations. We should resist talking in the name of transparency or trade facilitation while forgetting about the concrete measures. We had two decisions on food in MC12. So far, they have not added an additional morsel of grain to the needs of the vulnerable populations and countries. Here we are yet again talking about yet another declaration on Food Security uninhibited.</t>

                                <t>(iii) For India, there cannot be a decision on Food Security without a permanent solution to the PSH. Hence, we have suggested starting with JOB/AG/229 on a permanent solution for public stockholding, a joint proposal of three large groups accounting for more than 80 Members.</t>

                                <t>(iv) Some Members have said that PSH is one of the solutions to ensure food security and is not the only solution. We agree. In this regard, we have two points to mention.</t>

                                <t>One, we never said it was the only solution. We have also acknowledged some other views that state free trade can also play some role in rendering food security, though its impact is minimal. The FAO reports have clearly shown that only 17 per cent of the world's food is traded across borders. Further, during the pandemic time, free trade in agriculture or the so-called agriculture-producing countries failed to rise to the occasion when required. So, according to us, the argument that free trade ensures food security fell flat and square on its face during the past COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the PSH programme of India remained resilient and provided for 800 million people for more than 18 months.</t>

                                <t>Second, food security is a non-trade issue, and WTO, with its limited reach of 17 per cent, cannot provide a solution to the global food security needs. Hence, it is only prudent that Members recognize this reality and let the permanent solution to PSH be delivered at the MC13; that is the only way to make progress in the otherwise stalemated Agriculture negotiations in the WTO.</t>

All Ministerial mandates must be respected. This is key to restoring trust that is severely lacking in agriculture trade negotiation – and preserving the integrity of the Ministerial Conference. Agreeing on a permanent solution is even more important now at the time of food crisis – and we need a PSH that cover all future programmes for food security purposes.</t>

                                <t>Now, on fisheries subsidies. We appreciate the efforts to put the CBDR principle in practice through the two-tier approach, as the Chair stated in his report at the TNC meeting. However, it is important that we agree on the parameter first. Second, it is important to tighten the discipline for those in the stricter tier, not just by way of adding notification obligation, but also through additional responsibility to change the status quo. Reducing the capacity of large-scale fishing vessels and/or distant water fishing vessels is one example. On the SDT, it is unfortunate that the objective for this discipline is to ensure that the less members that can access the flexibility under the provision, the better. That is not what effective and appropriate SDT is.</t>

However, where request to have interpretation service is provided, the same request to have an online presence of capital delegation due to clashing schedule is continued being denied, without offering any solution. Instead, we are asked in return to request the other formal negotiating body to change their schedule, because, and I quote "we have decided the date earlier". If there is a "good will", there will be a "good way". And this, is not the way.</t>

Despite repeated emphasis on our commitment to the Work Programme on Small Economies to adopt specific measures that would facilitate the fuller integration of SVEs into the multilateral trading system, as indicated in the Secretariat report (WT/COMTD/SE/W/45), SVEs participation in global merchandise trade has increased mere 0.05% from 2010 to 2019.</t>

                                <t>Therefore, there is a need for further work in order to fully achieve the mandate of the Doha Ministerial Declaration as indicated in the Chair's report. As highlighted at many forums, SVEs are diverse and dynamic on their own problems as well as solutions which could possibly go beyond the scope of the WTO. Therefore, external collaborations are very important, as indicated under the draft declaration.</t>

                                <t>The ACP Group thanks the CTD Chairperson for his leadership and his report. In line with the MC12 Ministerial mandate for small economies, Members agreed to a work programme to frame responses to the trade-related issues identified for the fuller integration of SVEs into the multilateral trading system. The MC12 decision resulted in a Secretariat factual analysis which underscores the vulnerability and the unique needs of SVE members thus the need for targeted support. We recognize, however, that more work is still needed to address the specific challenges and needs of small economies towards more tangible outcomes.</t>

In addition, resilience, and reliable supply chains given food security, trade costs and partnerships towards addressing climate change and mitigation form a key role for the small economies moving forward. With this, we recognize the role of the Secretariat which greatly assisted in delivering the outcomes of MC12 through the factual analysis that provides a useful basis for our work.</t>

These are compounded by the impact of climate change. We therefore commend the work undertaken in the Dedicated Session including experience sharing to address the trade challenges of SVEs and also to identify opportunities to address these challenges.</t>

We therefore urge Members to support this work going forward, which must deliver on the mandate, that is, to frame responses to the trade challenges faced by small vulnerable economies.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson said that in 2004, the General Council had instructed the Secretariat to continue to work with the development community and to provide the Council with periodic reports on the development assistance aspects of the Cotton Initiative. The Council had also instructed the Director-General to consult with the relevant international organizations, including the Bretton Woods Institutions, the FAO and the ITC, to direct effectively existing programmes and any additional resources towards development of the economies where cotton has vital importance.  She further noted that the Bali and Nairobi Decisions reaffirmed this mandate and invited the Director-General to continue to provide periodic reports.</t>

                                <t>On cotton development assistance, I am pleased to observe that, since the last Periodic Report in June 2022 and thanks to the dynamism of the C-4 and the positive response by the development community, we have made some remarkable progress.</t>

                                <t>Allow me to share some tangible progress since my last report. Firstly, we organized a successful Partners' Conference in July 2022 – we were pleased to witness a high level of interest and participation and, importantly, commitment from key partners. We contributed to the 2022 and 2023 editions of World Cotton Day celebrations – the commemoration of the day helped to shine a light on the important of cotton to the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across the global and importantly, those who have been adversely impacted by market distortions and pest and infestation.</t>

                                <t>Secondly, we started an innovative and action-oriented partnership with FIFA, specifically to support value addition activities in the C-4 and their partner countries as well as to drive value chain development by connecting existing supply with programmes such as football for schools, a FIFA/UNESCO support initiative. This project is already yielding some results which I will come back to a bit later.</t>

                                <t>On the positive side, there is also a genuine intention by the C-4 and their partner countries to invest in sustainable local processing and other value addition activities. Let me be clear, all of these efforts are about delivering for people-people that are far too often left behind. It is about doing our part to create decent jobs particularly for the youth and women, it is about ensuring the economic conditions in cotton producing countries are sufficiently attractive that it helps mitigate the phenomenon of illegal migration and the tragedies that far too often follow.</t>

                                <t>The objective of integrating cotton from the C-4 and their partner countries into national and continental apparel supply chains linked to football is at the core of this endeavor. Of course, we hope that this will be a catalyst for demand and hope that production and supply of textiles from the C-4 will ultimately go beyond this specific value chain.</t>

                                <t>The African Group would like to thank you for including this important item on the agenda and express its support for the interventions by the C-4 and Côte d'Ivoire. Cotton farming provides a living for tens of millions of people around the world. Cotton and its by-products are essential to the economies of over 150 countries involved in producing, processing, importing and/or exporting cotton. More specifically, in Africa and particularly for the four co-sponsors of the Sectoral Initiative on Cotton (C-4), cotton plays a key role in the daily lives of the inhabitants of cotton-growing basins, estimated at more than 20 million people, who derive the bulk of their income directly or indirectly from cotton. There is no doubt that, for these countries, it remains a strategic, vital crop that contributes significantly to agricultural production, the economy, trade and employment and provides indisputable leverage in the fight against poverty, particularly in rural areas.</t>

                                <t>Cotton trade negotiations have not thus far produced results, despite the many proposals made by the C-4. We believe that MC13 should send a strong signal in terms of the perspectives on cotton at the WTO. The African Group supports the draft decision submitted by the C-4 and Côte d'Ivoire, which seeks to secure a consensual outcome by MC13. Pending the necessary desired developments in terms of trade negotiation outcomes, the African Group would like to call on bilateral and multilateral partners to support the development of cotton farming in Africa in order to contribute not only to structural solutions to constraints that hinder the competitiveness of the African cotton sector, but also to yield improvement and the local processing of cotton and its by-products.</t>

This demonstrates the need to continue supporting cotton farmers in LDCs. In this regard, the LDC Group commends all development partners who have provided support to cotton-producing LDCs through the implementation of different types of development projects.</t>

                                <t>We therefore believe that MC13 should send a reassuring message on cotton and that there should be continued fulfilment of the commitments Members made to address cotton "ambitiously, expeditiously and specifically" as part of the agriculture negotiations. To that end, the C-4 has submitted a draft decision on cotton and hopes that a broad consensus will be reached on this draft with a view to its adoption at MC13.</t>

                                <t>Cotton is of high importance for LDCs, especially for those 30 African countries that produce or trade it. Brazil supports, in the framework of a comprehensive reform of the AoA, an outcome on cotton at the 13th Ministerial Conference. Brazil continues to support LDCs in cotton and cotton-related sectors through the Brazilian Programme to Support the Development of the Cotton Sector in Africa. The Brazilian cooperation aims at increasing cotton productivity and improve fiber quality in 18 African countries. As highlighted by the report, the south-south contribution is a form of cooperation based on solidarity, with shared goals of improving productivity, inclusiveness, and sustainability in the cotton sector.</t>

                                <t>The cotton sector needs to be reformed urgently, since, as evidenced in the Cairns Group document on concentrations of support, cotton is still one of the most distorted sectors, with its support heavily concentrated among just a few Members. We support the C-4's efforts to create fairer, more equitable and more market-oriented trade in the cotton sector. As proponents of the Cairns Group paper on modalities for domestic support, contained in JOB/AG/243/Rev.1, we are convinced that the alternatives set out therein will further this objective. Lastly, as we did in the CoA SS, we would like to invite the C-4 to work together with us to develop the market access pillar in its future proposals.</t>

                                <t>China thanks the DG for her report. China has 27 million cotton farmers and the majority of them are small-scale farmers. Therefore, we fully understand the critical role that cotton sector plays in C-4 and other African cotton producing Members. We appreciate the very positive remarks by the DG's report on South-South cooperation on Cotton, quote, "Brazil, China, India and Pakistan have continued to provide significant support to LDCs in cotton and cotton-related sectors. These Members' contribution is particular remarkable as a form of cooperation based on solidarity, and on these Members' shared goal of improving productivity, inclusiveness, and sustainability in the cotton sector", end of the quote. China will continue to strengthen our cotton development support and cooperation through South-South Cooperation and other platforms.</t>

After the successful completion of the first phase of the Cotton Technical Assistance Program, phase two of the CTAP is being implemented over a five-year period. It includes five additional African countries making it to a total of 11 countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, Togo, Tanzania and Gambia. The focus of CTAP 2 is increasing cotton production and improving the post-harvest and plant byproducts industry in the participating countries, as well as building the capacity of the cotton-based textile sector.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson said that the item contained two sub-items and she proposed to take both items up together, and to open the floor only once. She recalled that, in August 2003, the General Council had adopted a Decision on the Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. She further noted that the General Council had also adopted, in December 2005, a Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement. In accordance with Article X:3 of the WTO Agreement, the Protocol had entered into force on 23 January 2017, upon acceptance by two-thirds of the WTO Members. She recalled that both the amended TRIPS Agreement and the 2003 Decision provided that the TRIPS Council shall review annually the functioning of the system and shall also report on its operation to the General Council. She further recalled that the Members that were yet to accept the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement currently had until 31 December 2023 to do so. She then invited Ambassador Pimchanok Pitfield (Thailand), Chairperson of the Council for TRIPS, to report on these two matters.</t>

Despite indications that a number of Members are making domestic efforts in this regard, there are still 27 WTO Members that are yet to accept the Protocol. The TRIPS Council, therefore, agreed to propose to the General Council a decision to extend the period for acceptance by two more years, i.e., until 31 December 2025.

Indeed, we see once again how the amendment to the TRIPS Agreement establishing Article 31bis and thereby the special compulsory licensing mechanism, has not worked as it should. Despite the considerable efforts of the Secretariat and certain countries, the mechanism has not actually been used, and its practical impact is far from striking the desired balance identified when discussions began in 2001.</t>

                                <t>I would like to point out that the same thing seems to be happening with the waiver agreed upon at MC12. The waiver has not been used once, and its practical impact is far from striking the desired balance identified when discussions began in 2020. When we broaden the waiver, it will likely lead to an increase in its use – and we will discuss this tomorrow – but as things stand, the fact is that it has not been used. The problem is that when we agreed on these flexibilities, we ladened them with so many requirements and conditions that we made them unfeasible in practice. While the solutions have proved ineffective, the problem remains.</t>

                                <t>Both initiatives sought to resolve the rigidity of export and import requirements for a number of countries. The most important part of the special mechanism under Article 31bis and of the COVID-19 waiver revolves around Article 31(f) of the TRIPS Agreement, in other words around the artificial restriction on export markets imposed by this requirement. With this requirement, the WTO went far beyond what was established for unauthorized uses in the WIPO Agreements.</t>

                                <t>The decisions we reached in the past acknowledged this problem. But the solutions we offered have not worked as they should, and the problem is far from being resolved. It has been and will be repeated. The Article 31(f) limitation is and will be a restriction that is unfair and too strict for two groups of developing countries that cannot make proper use of the counterbalances under the TRIPS Agreement - countries that are net importers (limited by the lack of local manufacturing) and sandwich countries (limited by their naturally small market size).</t>

                                <t>With this in mind, I would like to call for an in-depth review of this restriction in the medium term. In light of the unsuccessful experiences we have accumulated, such as the one being reviewed under this agenda item today, we should recognize that this is a key issue that we must address together and that we cannot weigh it down with new requirements, annexes, appendices and footnotes that would eventually make the solution unworkable. To restore the balance established in the TRIPS Agreement, we need to find a relevant, comprehensive solution to the problem clearly outlined in this report.</t>

                                <t>Members were also in agreement that the proposed increase of an additional 0.9 per cent for 2025 (the second year of the biennium) can be put aside for now and discussed in the context of a possible mid-term review in 2024.</t>

                                <t>Moreover, there was strong support by most Members to endorse the recommendation by the WTO Pension Management Board regarding the closing of the funding gap and to establish a Working Group to examine the question of deeper pension reform. There was also broad agreement that action must be taken to address the funding gap in the near term, and not in the much longer period of time that would be required to consider deeper structural changes to the Pension Plan.</t>

                                <t>Personally, I believe that it is unfortunate that we were not able to take a decision regarding the immediate question of the Pension Plan funding gap, while simultaneously establishing a Working Group to examine and, if appropriate, propose longer term structural reform of the WTOPP. Staff and retirees deserve a stable pension, so we must return to close the funding gap quickly.</t>

                                <t>Switzerland would like to thank the Chair of the CBFA for her report and the hard work she has put, together with the Secretariat and delegations, into this process. The compromise found for which we could establish consensus is not the optimal solution in our view, as we would have been ready to accept the DG's initial budget proposal. It is about securing the resources enabling the Secretariat to deliver high quality services as requested by Members. But we understand the budgetary constraints and caution of many Members. In that sense, the solution found represents a reasonable and responsible compromise. We already now invite all Members to carefully examine the Secretariat's resource situation at the next Mid-Term Review, upcoming before the end of 2024.</t>

We are in favour of establishing a Working Group to examine a more fundamental reform of the Pension Plan, but this is a complex issue and will take time. At the same time, there is a clear cost of waiting to fill the actuarial gap in the Pension Plan which is currently increasing steadily. We urge Members to address the situation in early 2024 in the CBFA in order to agree on a timely solution before examining the possibilities of a more fundamental reform.</t>

                                <t>My intervention is just on call to the WTO membership. We have been talking in this house on the need to support the Secretariat to be more productive. We also have been talking among ourselves on the need to enhance processes – even on negotiations, we have established that trust has been a challenge, and because of that we have not been reaching convergence in most of the issues. In recent times, we observed certain things that needed to be improved in the WTO. With the efficient leadership presently, they have come up with solutions through which these challenges to Secretariat will be addressed. So, the issue of additional requests for funding was presented before Members, and we met several times. We made observations. The Secretariat went back and responded to those questions, and I feel that in terms of budgeting, it really should not be an issue. Our target on the Secretariat is much, and to get those results, then we have to support them with their budget request. I urge those Members who still have concern to reflect and change their mind, so that we can immediately approve the support and request by WTO, so that they can give us the best that we want.</t>

                                <t>Singapore is pleased that following the extensive and thorough discussion on the WTO 2024-2025 biennium budget, the CBFA is now able to present a budget proposal to the GC. As noted in WT/BFA/218, the CBFA met a total of thirteen times since July 2023 to discuss the budget, which gives Members a good sense of the importance of this matter. Allow me to make three brief points.</t>

                                <t>First, when the Director-General first presented her budget proposal in July 2023, Singapore stated clearly that we were prepared to positively consider it for three reasons. One, Singapore's consistent position is that if Members want to ensure that the WTO is fit for purpose, it has to be equipped with the necessary resources. Two, Singapore is satisfied that the Secretariat has been prudent and transparent in its management of the budget. In fact, the Secretariat conducted five informal technical sessions to address various issues, including HR policies, staffing considerations, and travel expenditure. Three, Singapore is of the view that the budget proposal has taken into account Members' sensitivities and budgetary challenges.</t>

                                <t>Second, Singapore can join the consensus on the recommendations contained in WT/BFA/217 even though it is sub-optimal. The 3.6 per cent increase and the use of CHF 2m from the 2021 surplus will allow the Secretariat to respond to key pressure points such as inflation and non-recurring expenditures.</t>

                                <t>Third, we should seriously examine how we can better manage the budget approval process and avoid such a last-minute scramble. It would also be helpful to begin consultations on the next mid-term budget review discussion and take into account DG Ngozi's report during the TNC on 12 December 2023 concerning the Secretariat's transformation process and strategic vision.</t>

We appreciate the consensus emerging among Members, noting in particular the careful analysis of the elements set out in the recommendations. The proposal for a 3.6 per cent increase in the operational budget for 2024 and 2025 reflects our commitment to strengthen WTO operations. We also welcome the proposal regarding the use of the 2021 surplus, including returning CHF 4 million to Members, as a sign of responsible financial management. We trust that, with further discussion, the Pension Plan can reach a satisfactory consensus.</t>

                                <t>I would like to sincerely thank Members for approving a modest budget increase for the WTO. I want to thank all those who supported an even higher proposal and worked hard. I want to thank all of you that worked for the compromise, and finally got all Members around it. It is much appreciated. This is the Organization's first adjustment in the past 12 years of zero nominal growth. I am pleased that we have been successfully proving to you the need for this request, especially at a time that is hard for many of you. I appreciate your recognition of pressing inflationary and contractual obligations. This compromise brought together different groups of Members - those that wanted full increase of 7.4 per cent as I had originally requested, those who wanted something less than a full increase, and those that preferred to stay at zero nominal growth. In addition, the compromise will result in a credit of CHF 4 million against Members' 2024 contributions.</t>

It shows that you Members care about this Organization, and that we do is useful for you and the people you represent. This is an important signal - especially as we prepare for MC13. That is why we fought so hard. This compromise shows that we can agree by consensus and deliver here in Geneva. It is also a vital show of support for our staff and will help with staff morale. I am grateful for this point, as we mentioned to you, or as I had said during my CBFA interventions, you may not know it, but staff morale was a serious issue.</t>

                                <t>I would like to thank the Pension Management Board and its Chair for all the work done on how to address the funding gap in WTO's pension plan. Although most were ready to join consensus to adopt the Boards' recommendation and establish a working group to consider broader reform. As we heard, a few Members were not yet ready to join this consensus. As such, we will not be able to proceed on this matter today, and as the Chair said, we will defer it to next year. In the meantime, the gap continues to grow. Staff members and retirees deserve a stable predictable and well-functioning pension plan, it's a top priority to them and something they look at. As they work, they need to know that when they leave their future will be secured. Therefore, I am happy to hear that Members will revert to this matter early next year. This will give staff some hope. I look forward to doing all we can to work with Members, so that the pension matter can be settled as quickly, and the working group is established to get some results. I wish to thank all Members once more for making this gesture. It's a good Christmas gesture.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson noted that at the July meeting, the General Council agreed that the Sub-Committee on LDCs would continue the discussion on Annex 2 of the LDC graduation proposal contained in WT/GC/W/807/Rev.2 and to report to the General Council by 30 November 2023 with any recommendations. She then offered the floor to Ambassador José R. Sanchez-Fung (Dominican Republic), the Chairperson of the Committee on Trade and Development, who had been chairing the meetings of the Sub-Committee on LDCs since September 2023, pending the election of the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on LDCs.</t>

                                <t>Following the instruction by the General Council in July this year to examine Annex 2 of the LDC graduation proposal, the LDC Sub-Committee began its work in September. I have provided a succinct summary of the main discussions in my report to the General Council which has been circulated in document WT/COMTD/LDC/30.</t>

                                <t>First, we have tried our best to advance the discussions through informal sessions of the LDC Sub-Committee. We have had five informal meetings and one small group consultation. All the 17 S&amp;D provisions identified by LDCs in Annex 2 were taken up in clusters, and we had a good exchange of views on all the key issues in the proposal ranging from market access to subsidies to intellectual property matters. We now have a better understanding of the background of all the LDC-specific provisions in WTO Agreements and decisions identified in Annex 2.</t>

                                <t>Second, the discussions were facilitated by the factual presentations from the Secretariat. I would like to thank the Secretariat for being available at short notice. We have also been reassured that a wide range of technical assistance remains available to graduating LDCs for their effective participation in the system.</t>

                                <t>Third, the discussions have been substantive. I would like to thank Members for their positive and constructive engagements. We have covered a lot of ground. At the same time, I believe some further discussion is necessary to better understand the specific challenges of graduating LDCs and to explore possible avenues for support. I would, therefore, like to request the General Council to provide some additional time to the LDC Sub-Committee to further examine the provisions in Annex 2 with a view to making any possible recommendations to the General Council to ensure a smooth transition for graduating LDCs. We can also try to use the limited time we have before MC13 to see whether some progress can be made, for Ministers consideration at MC13.</t>

                                <t>As highlighted in the report of the LDC Sub-Committee Chair, we have gone through an in-depth review of the different LDC-specific provisions listed in Annex 2 of our proposal, and explained the rationale for extending them to graduated LDCs for a reasonable period of time.  The LDC-specific provisions in WTO have been approved by the whole membership to respond to the unique vulnerabilities affecting LDCs, and that WTO Members have already recognized that they should equally apply to all LDCs. Since graduation is not changing the inherited challenges overnight, LDC-specific provisions should also be available to Members for some years after their graduation from the LDC category.</t>

                                <t>The LDC Group welcomes the GC Decision (WT/L/1172) on Annex-1, as we were about to begin the SOM. The decision constitutes an important first part agreement and has given us the needed momentum toward MC13. The decision on 23 October also addresses several of the market access-related issues listed in Annex 2. Based on these considerations, the LDC Group is ready to review the list of provisions in Annex 2 with a view to reducing those provisions.</t>

                                <t>Given the critical importance of this issue for the LDC Group, we must avoid endless debates on questions that have already been answered by the LDC Group. This will delay any action on this second part of the LDC graduation proposal.</t>

                                <t>At this stage, Members should first agree on the principle of a transition period, which would apply to the provisions listed in Annex 2 for a fixed number of years. We can therefore ask the LDC Sub-Committee to continue its work as provided in the July 2023 GC meeting and report back to the General Council by 31 January 2024 with precise recommendation to make favourable decision by MC13 in this regard.</t>

                                <t>The General Council decision in October on Annex 1, concerning unilateral DFQF preferences, is a clear recognition that a transition period after graduation from the LDC category is crucial. Achieving a successful outcome on Annex 2 will also send a strong signal that the multilateral trade system can be responsive to the needs of its more vulnerable Members.</t>

Paragraph 5 of the MC12 Outcome Document acknowledged the challenges of LDCs including the loss of trade-related international support measures after graduation and recognizes the importance of WTO measures to address those challenges. We reaffirm our support for this proposal because we believe graduated LDCs require support during their transition period to foster stability.</t>

                                <t>There are some countries that have met the graduation criteria; however, their economic and social indicators are still very low. Since graduation is not changing the inherited challenges overnight, LDC-specific provisions should also be available to Members for some years after their graduation from the LDC category. Nepal's scheduled graduation is unique that it has not met the GNI criteria and will be graduating without meeting this criterion.  Furthermore, we have been facing the several challenges like adverse impact of climate change, inflation, currency depreciation, price hike and natural disaster like floods, and recently, earthquake just one month ago.</t>

To facilitate a smooth transition by LDCs, we would suggest that members conclude their examination of the list of provisions proposed by the LDC Group in order to establish a "menu of measures" for which LDCs can request a short, time-limited extension after graduation.

Norway wants results on MC13 on Annex 2. We must intensify our efforts in January to find a landing zone. What is needed? We think we need a clear prioritization of some provisions ripe for harvest at MC13. We have two reasonable, meaningful and bridging concrete suggestions to make. First, we might have a text in MC13 outcome document on WTO commitment to needs-based demand driven technical assistance; and second, have to explore a peace clause as way to shorten Annex 2, making it easier and achieving the same results.</t>

                                <t>We thank the CTD Chair for his report, and for the extensive work undertaken in the LDC Sub-Committee to examine Annex 2 of the LDC Graduation proposal. We agree with the Chair's very good report. The UK wants to see an agreement reached on LDC Graduation Annex II at MC13. To get there, as Norway said, we really need to intensify our discussions in the LDC Subcommittee. There are clearly still elements that need to be worked through, and like Norway and others, we are very happy and keen to come forward with proposals to find ways to work it through. But it is critical that we have very focused, intensified discussions in January to ensure that we can deliver on this important issue at MC13.</t>

                                <t>The African Group welcomes the decision of the General Council (WT/L/1172) on Annex 1, as we were about to begin the Senior Officials' Meeting. The decision constitutes an important first agreement and has given us the necessary momentum towards MC13. The 23 October decision also addresses several of the market access issues listed in Annex 2. The October General Council decision on Annex 1, regarding unilateral FDSC preferences, is a clear recognition because a transition period after graduation from the LDC category is crucial. Achieving a positive outcome on Annex 2 will also send a strong signal that the multilateral trading system can meet the needs of its most vulnerable Members.</t>

                                <t>We have repeatedly stressed that we find it difficult to understand the strong resistance by some Members of this proposal by the LDC Group which will neither affect the economic competitiveness of those Members who continue to oppose it nor grant undue rights to this subset of Members, the majority of whom belong to the African Group. The African Group believes that the difficulties encountered by graduating LDCs in implementing WTO rules and disciplines must continue to be addressed. Much progress has been made, but we believe that a thorough review of the 17 SDT proposals identified in Annex 2 would require additional time with a view to making recommendations to the General Council.</t>

By agreeing on these measures, WTO Members can help mitigate these challenges, ensure a smooth transition to a more level playing field, and prevent LDCs from regressing. We believe that prioritizing these issues will allow WTO Members to play a vital role in supporting LDC graduation and promoting sustainable development in these nations.</t>

                                <t>Angola continues to fully support the revised document WT/GC/W/807/Rev.2 proposed by the LDC Group urging WTO Members to enable future graduated countries to continue to benefit from the flexibilities currently enjoyed by LDCs, ensuring a smooth transition and a sustainable exit from the category. This debate started in the General Council gathered on 16-17 December 2020, continued in October 2021 GC, and received a contextual uphold with the MC12 ministerial declaration on LDCs preferential rules of origin, services waiver, duty-free quota-free market access, and positive actions regarding graduation from the LDC category. On this path, Angola is particularly pleased that the General Council could adopt the important decision WT/L/1172 on the Annex-1 or DFQF, thus recognizing the critical gravity of a congruent and smooth transitional period for countries graduating from the LDC category.</t>

                                <t>Allow us to recall again the regrettable situation with which countries like Angola were suddenly confronted since we should have already graduated in 2021 and then postponed to 2024 due to the irruption of the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The postponement of this long waiting graduation process had several negative consequences, eroding economic confidence, favorable access to capital, investment, loans, and trade markets, thus contradicting the political and social mobilization of Angolan public and civil organizations who fought several years for graduation from the LDC category as a just reward for their efforts in work, reforms and modernization of the country. Moreover, removing the LDCs from subdevelopment, economic crisis, and social poverty is not a mere national ambition but a global imperative that should be a permanent concern of the WTO. Angola reiterates that this is not a merciful agency but a critical global commitment towards sustainable world development. Consequently, Angola expects that the forthcoming MC13 will approve a formal declaration on a smooth and assisted transition from the LDC category for a pertinent period of time that includes exemption from action under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, extension of guarantees of LDC-specific special flexibilities, and continuation of technical assistance as listed in the Appendix of Annex 2 to the present proposal.</t>

                                <t>Brazil acknowledges the efforts of the CTD Chair on the LDC "Smooth and Sustainable" transition after Graduation. We took part in the discussions in a substantive and constructive way, supporting the demands of the LDC Group and listening to other Members comments. We acknowledge that some Members required more time for an in-depth examination of the existing LDC-specific flexibilities listed in Annex 2. We hope that such an in-depth analysis does not cost the LDCs years of waiting that will in the end result in a watered-down decision. The existing LDC-specific flexibilities provisions have passed the test of multilateralism, in the sense that they were extensively and carefully negotiated among Members. Its extension or reinstatement should not be the object of renewed, lengthy negotiations, rather a prompt recognition that trade in the last 30 years has not fulfilled its promises of economic growth or full employment, in particular for the least-developed Members of this Organization.</t>

                                <t>I would also like to echo our appreciation to the CTD Chair for his leadership and his comprehensive and objective report. Singapore warmly welcomes the Decision on Annex 1 of the LDC Graduation Proposal, and the progress made on Annex 2. First, we agree with the Chair's report that more time is needed for discussions on Annex 2, and it will be pragmatic to use MC13 as a checkpoint to take stock of the progress made. Second, we should use the remaining time to continue engaging constructively on Annex 2 through fact-based discussions. We should seek to better understand the challenges faced by graduated LDCs, and how the proposed provisions will promote their development. Third, as the MC12 outcome document emphasised, SDTs should be "precise, effective, and operational", hence it should be tailored to the specific needs of Members. Singapore will continue to engage closely and constructively with Members to realize Annex 2.</t>

From the LDC perspective, it is important that we work constructively on this Annex 2, so that we are in a position to conclude the discussions by the end of January. We heard and I wish to reiterate thanks to CTD Chair for his leadership. We are ready to continue work under his leadership. I would urge delegations to really, kindly use time we have available. Time is of the essence. We really think it is up to the political will. This will make the difference on how we use the time before MC13. As we repeatedly said, as LDCs, we do not need to wait to be in Abu Dhabi to gavel on Annex 2. We can have this outcome endorsed by Ministers like Annex 1, but we really need to speed up our engagement here, so that we know what we are bringing in our luggage when we get to Abu Dhabi.</t>

                                <t>Thank you for the support this proposal received in July. For those who are new to this proposal, what we have proposed are a series of modest tweaks to the 2002 decision which would build on and enhance the transparency of documents while retaining the right of any Member to keep its own communications restrictions when necessary. It also adds guidance on the WTO website.</t>

However, we also believe that this has to balanced carefully against the confidentiality which some of our work demands. Paragraph 5 of the proposal, for example, could lead to sensitive negotiating documents and positions being exposed to the public prematurely. We perhaps need greater clarity on what types of documents and information are best suited to derestriction. Maybe we can even contemplate a trial basis for certain types of documents with the goal of ultimately arriving at a more comprehensive approach.</t>

There are some paragraphs we are supporting, but there are some paragraphs which we would still like to discuss with the proponent. Therefore, we are of the view that these would require further discussion. Maybe it would be appropriate that the first round of work is done in the CTG and maybe in other Councils too, because a similar thing was done in the Committee on Market Access.</t>

                            <p>
                                <t>Over the course of the past few months, my delegation has been engaging with many Members on WT/GC/W/908. We have consulted widely, with both developed and developed Members, with various groups including the Cairns Group, G10, G33, ACP, Africa Group, LDCs, OECS, and Pacific Group. Based on the consultations, which were very useful, we have distilled what we gathered were the possible elements into the Communication that you see before you today. I will make three brief points.</t>

                                <t>First, let me share what this paper is not about. One, it is not intended to distract or detract from the critical discussions at CoA SS. Singapore recognizes the importance that many Members attach to the ongoing negotiations and will continue to support it. In fact, we have heard from many during our consultations, Members can walk and chew gum at the same time. Two, it is not meant to compete with other proposals at CoA SS. In fact, we have stated this clearly in Paragraph 8, which urges Members to consider in greater detail the relevant submissions submitted to date. Given the challenges in the CoA SS discussions, it is important that Members continue to consider all dimensions of food insecurity and the steps that we can take to address them. Three, this paper is certainly not meant to be a silver bullet to resolve all dimensions of the food insecurity challenges. Any such effort will certainly require all Members to work together to seek a win-win outcome.</t>

                                <t>Second, let me share what this paper is about. One, it is a modest attempt to contribute to an MC13 outcome. It is a response to the almost unanimous emphasis that Members have placed on addressing the challenges of food insecurity. Two, this proposal is targeted at the short to medium term. In other words – what can we meaningfully do in the six working weeks that we have left to MC13? Three, this paper brings together elements that we see as realistic and credible, in areas such as export restrictions, added transparency, exemptions for LDCs and increased international collaboration.</t>

                                <t>Third, let me share what this paper can be. One, this paper can be a stepping stone to build confidence and continue negotiations, after MC13. Two, it would send an important signal to the global community that our Ministers are able to collectively respond to the current and pressing challenges of food insecurity. Three, the proposals in this paper might be modest, but they are meaningful in making a difference to many food-insecure Members, particularly the LDCs.</t>

                                <t>We believe a medium and long-term solution to food security challenges can only be delivered through a MC13 outcome that include substantive food security and livelihoods package with decisions on issues under negotiations in the CoA SS such as PSH, and SSM, as well as outcome on domestic support especially with regards to levelling the playing field.

                                <t>We believe the Singapore proposal which is confined to issues of transparency and new disciplines on export restrictions cannot be part of a medium or long-term solution to food security challenges. The African Group holds this view for four important reasons. First, existing disciplines are sufficient and balanced to address export restrictions as well as to safeguard policy space when required to address essential food needs of Members in times of critical food shortages. Second, GATT Article XI and Article 12 of the AoA balance the obligation with the need. Any effort to increase obligations on removing export restrictions while not recognizing domestic needs to address food crisis will adversely affect this balance. Third, there is lack of hard evidence that freeing up exports will provide the needed solution to food crises and food security. Lastly, due to resource and capacity constraint, we are not in a position to undertake further transparency obligation.</t>

Like many SIDS, Fiji faces multiple challenges in ensuring food security and nutrition for its population. Taking guidance from the FAO, food imports outweigh food production as source of many SIDS. We recall here Dr. Ngozi's call at G20 Summit in Bali last year to reduce or eliminate export restrictions, following also on the MC12 outcome.</t>

                                <t>We appreciate Singapore's proposal. In light of the current situation, it is important to demonstrate the WTO's commitment to addressing food insecurity at MC13. Supply chain disruptions particularly affected vulnerable countries, and it is important to ensure smooth trade in agricultural products as one of the factors that contributes to global food security and will complement each Member's domestic production.</t>

We hope that all the proponents, and us also, we are happy to join the conversation, that we can work together on the topic.

                                <t>Food security remains a critical challenge for developing countries, especially LDCs and NFIDCs. We consider it a sensitive subject, which as a delegation we have often referred to as a national security matter. We believe that countries facing greater burden of food security should themselves decide on suitable solution for food security, and not have solutions superimposed from outside. Special safeguard mechanism, PSH and other domestic support measures can improve domestic food security particularly in NFIDCs and LDCs, if implemented carefully and responsibly. Further, we believe that any policy space provided under GATT Article XI.2 and AoA Article 12 may serve as an important instrument to avert risk of encountering critical shortages of food stuff. We also fully subscribe to the wisdom captured in AoA, which clearly states that food security is a non-trade concern. While we acknowledge that trade can help; food security should not be looked at from perspective from trade alone. It should rather consider the wider array of solution to food insecurity challenges. A call which we also heard a few days ago from Ministers during the Ministerial meeting. Finally, we align with statements of the African Group.</t>

                                <t>My following statement is for both items 11 and 13. China supports reaching food security outcomes for the vulnerable members at MC13. We commend Singapore and African Group's efforts in this regard. We see valuable elements from both papers which could constitute the potential elements of MC13 integrated food security outcome package. We believe food security outcomes could be achieved if we are working in a pragmatic way and we believe some recommendations from both proposals could constitute the potential elements of MC13 integrated food security outcome package. We hope members can engage with goodwill, show sincerity and move towards each other to explore practical food security outcomes in the next 2 months. For China, we reiterate that food security should be a part of MC13 deliverables. On export restriction, China commends Singapore's continuous efforts on responding to food insecurity after the remarkable WFP outcomes at MC12.</t>

On the basis of implementing the MC12 Ministerial Declaration on food security, China supports improving the discipline of export restrictions in accordance with the current rules, so as to ensure that members can better fulfil the existing WTO obligations. However, the requirements beyond the existing rules need to be carefully studied and deliberated. China also stresses that the disciplines of export restrictions should take full account of the capacity and resource constraints of developing Members to ensure that the relevant discipline is practical for them.</t>

Elements of such outcome could include enhanced transparency on areas related to food security challenges (such as food aid, export restrictions) as well as clarifications of the rules on export restrictions which would limit their unjustified use. The proper functioning of the markets is essential so that supplies can reach those that need them most.

In today's world, we are facing a chronic problem - food insecurity. Unfortunately, there are few prospects for a rapid solution to this serious humanitarian and human rights challenge.

Agricultural trade that is stable and free of distortions and barriers is, in the long term, the most effective response to address the problem of food security. Short-term solutions can only be effective if they form part of a wider process that would take place if the negotiations under Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture were implemented, covering all pillars of the negotiation in a comprehensive manner. We call for this proposal to be included in the discussions of the Committee on Agriculture. This contribution can play a positive role in these discussions and in a Committee where other food security-related proposals are also being taken into consideration.</t>

Addressing food security, we need to deal not only with the interests of net importers but with those of all other participants of the international trade, including the exporters. Moreover, we stand for a systemic and balanced approach to food security in all its dimensions, rather than deliberately and unjustifiably focusing on one element. We deem that global food security is based on joint efforts of Members and all the Members are interdependent on each other in this sense. We fully agree with the fact, outlined in the communication by Singapore that "high prices undermine food security and nutrition for all Members".</t>

                                <t>But some provisions of this proposal seem to be not realistic. In particular, the commitment to refrain from imposing export prohibitions or restrictions on essential foodstuff imported by least-developed countries, even in circumstances set out in Article XI:2(a) of the GATT 1994, seems to be not elaborated enough. In particular, we find it not feasible in the situation of critical shortage of foodstuffs in any country to prevent it from protection of their population of famine. We shall add, that we have witnessed numerous instances when the measures imposed by certain WTO Members had a deteriorating effect on the exports of other Members. The concerns were consistently raised under the CoA review process.</t>

                                <t>So, we are certain that we need to tackle not only export restrictions per se but as well other measures having detrimental effect on food security. Any new modalities and further discussions should be based on this approach so to discipline their application in the same manner as export restrictions. We believe that the discussion of the ER in agriculture is incomplete without addressing unilateral economic measures that are a huge challenge and impediment to global food security, international trade and growth.</t>

                                <t>We thank Singapore for its proposal on the immediate steps to respond to food insecurity, which acknowledges the current global food insecurity and the way of addressing it. For the remaining limited weeks prior to MC13, it is desirable for Members to focus on addressing problems arising from a possible disruption of food supply chain caused by export restrictions, which lead to severe fluctuations in the domestic market of importing Members, particularly the net-food importing Members. This is the "minimum" element for food security issues to make a meaningful contribution to the world. Singapore's suggestion is in line with the idea of focusing on a possible achievable for MC13. We welcome further conversations on this matter to enhance transparency and other disciplines for export restrictions.</t>

                                <t>We have taken note of Singapore's submission. When taken from a net food importing developing country perspective, there are of course always concerns about stringent export restrictions that are dealt with through goodwill agreements, as such agreements however helpful, do not provide certainty to food deficit importers. But we must also address the source of the problem that today impacts on food security and therefore directly affects those faced with food deficit. A solution to food insecurity must therefore be also addressed through domestic support regulation and capacity to undertake stockholding when necessary.</t>

Therefore, we believe it would be very important to discuss the matter further.

                                <t>We are grateful to Singapore for its proposal. We find it instructive that the WTO Director-General's annual overview of developments in the international trading environment, presented on 7 December at a meeting of the Trade Policy Review Body, indicates that trade restrictions continue to weigh on global trade, with persistent export restrictions contributing to food price volatility. Added to this, the polycrisis environment lends greater weight to the pressing need for a discrete food security package at MC13.</t>

                                <t>In the OECS, inflation, public debt and climate change represent the antecedents for food insecurity.

In our view, the current disciplines on Export Restrictions both in the GATT (Article XI) and the AoA (Article 12) is sufficient and balanced to address export restrictions as well as to safeguard policy space when required to address essential food needs of Members in times of critical food shortages. In addition, we are also not in a position to support additional transparency obligations given capacity and resource constraint.</t>

                                <t>Food Security is of highest priority for my country. It goes without saying that food insecurity is a multifaceted issue, which need to be addressed through holistic solutions. Even among NFIDCs and LDCs, we see vast diversity relating to challenges they face relating to food security. This was well reflected during our sixteen-month long engagement under the dedicated Work Programme established as the MC12 Food Insecurity Declaration. Members amply reflected on the lack of advanced technology, lack of finance, limited or no investment in R&amp;D, limited access to credit; and insurance systems. Due to all these challenges, agricultural productivity and production is very low in NFIDCs and LDCs. In this context, there is an urgent need to make the agrifood systems of NFIDCs and LDCs more efficient, inclusive resilient and sustainable. This can be achieved only through enhancing agricultural production and productivity of NFIDCs and LDCs.</t>

                                <t>We need to take an array of measures towards this end, which may encompass technology transfer, long-term financial support, technical assistance and capacity building, etc. While we do not deny that trade is important for food security of any country, we wish to mention that the AoA has made it clear that food security is a non-trade concern. If we are serious in finding solutions to the food insecurity of NFIDCs and LDCs, we need to treat it as a non-trade issue.</t>

                                <t>Accordingly, our work at the WTO should aim at concrete measures that would provide long lasting solutions to the food insecurity of NFIDCs and LDCs. Such measures must take into consideration the specific needs and challenges of NFIDCs and LDCs. In this regard we reiterate our call for adopting measures to bolster the agricultural production and productivity of NFIDCs and LDCs.</t>

                                <t>India would like to thank the proponent for this agenda, though we would have preferred that this agenda could have come in CoA SS, like the proposals of the UK, Japan, and LDCs. But since it is there before us, let me comment on the proposal. So, first of all, let us understand that export restriction comes mostly in the supply-constrained scenario. And in the supply-constrained scenario, if you are not imposing the export restrictions, that means you are allowing your own people to be vulnerable to the supply-side shock.</t>
                            </p>

                                <t>At the same time, if you open up without any restriction or without any monitoring, it will lead to crowding out. This is exactly what happened in the first and second quarter of 2022. In the crisis, when India, which is not a traditional wheat-exporting country, saw a 400 per cent rise in the export of wheat. Incidentally, most of that wheat was going to one of the proponents of the removal of export restrictions. This wheat was not going to the bowl and plates of LDCs or NFIDCs, but it was going to the futures and options contractors and to those countries who can afford to have deep pockets to order more than their food requirement.</t>

                                <t>So let me give you three scenarios in honor of the proponent. As part of the safety instructions on flights, in cases of low oxygen, passengers are asked to cover themselves first before assisting infants. It doesn't mean that the mother, the parent, or the adult passenger is not concerned about the well-being of the infant. But the instruction is that first, you wear your oxygen mask and then try to help others. So, export restriction is one such example.</t>

                                <t>The second example is in the case of a car. If you don't allow the brake in a car, that means the car will never speed. So, the brake is not to reduce the speed, but it gives you freedom to accelerate. And if you remove that export restriction from the toolbox, which is available under GATT and AoA, it means you are not allowing trade to happen freely. In the absence of an export restriction tool, everyone will be too conservative to allow trade to happen.</t>

                                <t>And last but not least, we have seen in the previous agenda that in the name of duty-free quota, there is free access to big tech platforms, but we were saying that it is for the MSMEs of least developed countries and developing countries. In the same way, in the name of futures and option traders, we are saying it is for LDCs and NFIDCs, rather LDCs and NFIDC would get benefit in the case of export restriction if the G2G agreement can take place where due to availability of assured supply, affordable rate and transact serving available currency may help them.</t>

                                <t>The food security challenge is acute. The WTO has a clear role to play in responding to the food security crisis. This is an issue our Ministers are going to want to focus on when they reach Abu Dhabi, so it is right that we are considering what we can do here. That said there are live discussions happening in the CoA SS and we should continue discussing Singapore's ideas there. It is clear we have to progress negotiations towards a fair and market-oriented trading system, including on reducing trade-distorting support, which would be beneficial for food security globally.</t>

                                <t>We believe the efforts and progress made this year in CoA SS ought to allow us to be more specific and ambitious in the details of what is possible than is currently contained in this proposal.   As part of this wider work in the CoA SS it is clear that we need to begin to tackle export restrictions.  The UK has put forward a proposal, alongside proposals by the LDC Group and Japan. We see complementarity between those ideas and as encouraged by the CoA SS Chair we are actively engaged on bringing together the key elements of all three proposals. We plan to bring our ideas back to the membership in January, and we want to work with all Members, including Singapore, on what might be possible.</t>

                                <t>Tackling this issue needs to be part of a holistic outcome on agriculture at MC13. As we have said before, tackling export restrictions is not a substitute for progressing agriculture reform. There are high ambitions across the membership across all files on agriculture reform. We welcome and fully support the efforts by the CoA SS Chair to find a way through this challenging negotiation. As we said at TNC, let's now intensify discussions, including at HoD level, to ensure we deliver on Agriculture at MC13.</t>

                                <t>First, it is evident that there is broad recognition that it is important for MC13 to address the global food security challenges. Food security is of universal concern to all Members and will benefit from a broader, more sincere and constructive conversation in the General Council. It does not help the conversation if we use spurious examples to back spurious arguments. I think Members would be better served if we come together and agree on the importance of delivering an outcome at MC13. As I have stated in my opening presentation, this Communication is not intended to be a silver bullet. We have six weeks left. We must be pragmatic, realistic, and try our best to deliver an outcome that will serve the systemic interests of the WTO.</t>

                                <t>Third, there is evidently a trust deficit which some Members had highlighted earlier; and this deep-seated mistrust among Members, underpins an unfounded fear that addressing Export Restrictions to ease pressing food insecurity challenges will result in other important issues being left unaddressed. This is a zero-sum mindset that will not allow us to make progress.</t>

In the ministerial context, we are used to focusing on our negotiating agenda, but another important element of WTO's work is cooperation and dialogue that takes place in the regular Committees. In the regulatory area, this is of growing importance. Governments around the world are increasingly using regulations and standards to tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our time.</t>

                                <t>Indeed, we, as WTO Members, need to cooperate more if we want to effectively tackle the challenges ahead of us. I am thinking of health matters, or the environment and climate change, and of the digital economy. Regulatory cooperation helps ensure that we together address these important challenges although our regulatory systems may sometimes be different. In doing so, we need to be transparent, we need to share good practices, we need to promote capacity building. And we need to strengthen cooperation at the multilateral level. This is what the declaration is about.</t>

                                <t>Second, let me make some important clarifications about what this TBT Ministerial Declaration is not about. The declaration will not add to or detract from obligations or rights of members under the TBT Agreement. That is perhaps obvious, but I want to make it clear. The declaration intends to spotlight the importance and, indeed, the increasing relevance, of work on regulations that affect trade. It is remarkable that the TBT Agreement, now almost 30 years old – due to the constructive engagement of Members in its Committee - is still effective in addressing emerging global challenges faced by all of us today.</t>

                                <t>We, the co-sponsors, seek to emphasize the importance of regulatory cooperation and transparency in reducing unnecessary barriers to trade, including with respect to crucial emerging regulatory issues such as the protection of the environment, the emergence of the digital economy and public health matters. We underscore the value of transparency and call for further enhancement of our digital tools, such as ePing and eAgenda. Finally, we emphasize the importance of technical assistance and capacity building on TBT matters.</t>

                                <t>My third and last point, the TBT Ministerial Declaration will not create any new work streams for the TBT Committee. As I mentioned, the intention is to put a "ministerial spotlight" on the importance of regulatory cooperation at the multilateral level. The Declaration should push us to become more efficient. The substance of this work, of course, is left to the technical experts in the TBT Committee.</t>

                                <t>Finally, as the Director-General said when speaking at the launch of "Trade Day" last week in Dubai, "We need to use every weapon in our arsenal to fight the climate crisis". International cooperation on regulatory matters in the context of the WTO's regular work is a powerful but less known tool in the WTO toolbox. It helps us bridge differences and avoid trade friction. We certainly need this today. It is time that this be recognized at the Ministerial level.</t>

We note, for example, that close regulatory cooperation among Members was fundamental in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic by facilitating trade through the reduction or suspension of unnecessary regulatory barriers, the use of international standards or the temporary recognition of multiple standards and the reduction of unnecessary costs.</t>

                                <t>Technical regulation, standards and conformity assessment procedures can often be barriers to global trade. Developing countries that lack sophisticated systems to comply with TBT requirements can find themselves locked out of important markets. In this regard, we see a role for regulatory cooperation, exchange of information, transparency, predictability and technical assistance and capacity building and international recognition arrangements for accreditation. The proposal from the co-sponsors takes us in the right direction. We hope it will form the basis of a credible Ministerial declaration at MC13.</t>

                                <t>We thank China and the co-sponsoring Members for their proposed TBT Ministerial Declaration and are glad to be a co-sponsor ourselves as of now. We welcome the idea of this Ministerial Declaration emphasizing the importance of the TBT Committee in addressing modern global trade challenges such as tackling climate change, the digital economy and global health pandemics. Hence, we agree with China and other Members that it is important to draw the attention of Ministers to the invaluable contributions of the TBT Committee in removing barriers to trade and support the proposal circulated. Switzerland is therefore happy to co-sponsor this draft Ministerial Declaration.</t>

In response to rapidly evolving challenges, including the rise in technical barriers to trade, Korea firmly believes that the relevance of the WTO TBT Agreement is greater than ever. Enhancing transparency and strengthening international regulatory cooperation are crucial. So far, the TBT Agreement, along with SPS Agreement, has played an important role in the everyday operation of this house. Korea believes that drawing our ministers' attention to this issue at MC13 would be significantly beneficial in promoting and further enhancing the work of the TBT Committee, as well as continuing the implementation of the Agreement to meet our contemporary challenges. In this regard, expressing our support for the proposal, Korea looks forward to positive consideration from other Members.</t>

                                <t>We thank you for availing us this opportunity to present our proposed Draft Ministerial Decision on Promoting Agricultural Production and Trade in NFIDCs And LDCs. As we speak, Africa, and some Developing Countries are on the throes of a food crisis not seen before in recent times. Food insecurity is higher for developing countries, especially NFIDCs and LDCs, as they are unable to provide enough support to develop their agricultural sector, given the unfair WTO rules that constrain their policy space. Furthermore, they also do not have enough financial resources to import food from a concentrated and volatile global market. We believe in the context of the persistent state of global food insecurity that has disproportionately impacted NFIDCs and LDCs, it is of critical importance that MC13 delivers credible outcome that would avail NFIDCs and LDCs policy space needed to strengthen domestic production and enhance their participation in global trade.</t>

                                <t>The African Group Proposal has five elements that seeks to enhance LDCs and NFIDCs agriculture production and productivity; accessibility to food markets: access to finance for imports and enhancement of production; the productive capacity as well as transparency of Food Aid programmes and Export credit, guarantee and insurance initiatives. The first element centered to policy space that would enable NFIDCs and LDCs to provide AMS support for basic food stuff in excess of their applicable de-minimis limit in situations where they are net importers with imports accounting for greater than 45 per cent of domestic net food availability, in each year of the immediately preceding five calendar year period for which data is available; or in situation of food crisis when, for a month where the average monthly import price for that product exceeds a trigger price of 130% of the base period defined in the proposal. LDCs and NFIDC would revert to applicable de-minimis level when the situations that necessitated them to exceed their applicable de-minimis level improves or ceases to exist.</t>

It also contains a reaffirmation by Members to provide international food aid to LDCs and NFIDCs. Furthermore, it seeks to clarify the rules on repayment term in case of exceptional circumstances under para. 17 of the Nairobi Decision on Export Competition by proposing a 54- and 72-months extension of the time frame. The proposal also seeks to extend the benefits under Article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture in respect of the export subsidies to 2050 for LDCs and NFIDCs as against the 2030 deadline enshrined in paragraph 8 of the Nairobi decision.</t>

                                <t>The agricultural potential of our countries is underutilized in particular because of technological constraints and the fact that the vast majority of our producers are small or semi-subsistence farmers who remain very vulnerable to external shocks. Indeed, agricultural production and the supply chain have been disrupted in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the food and energy crises associated with the conflict in Ukraine. The periods of soaring prices that we have experienced intermittently since 2007 have also enormously weakened our economies. Now the major challenge for LDCs is to improve domestic agricultural production to build resilience and long-term preparedness against future crises and other supply chain disruptions, while ensuring product availability and affordability of basic foods, at affordable prices to meet our food security needs.</t>

                                <t>The OECS thanks the African Group for its communication. As WTO Members classified as net food importing developing countries, the OECS States imports a large share of the food that we utilize with some countries importing more than 80 per cent of total food consumption. Meanwhile, output from the agricultural sector has been declining since 1990, both in an absolute sense and as a percentage of gross domestic product. Furthermore, OECS countries have a low ration of cultivated land - suggesting a fundamental challenge for us to meet domestic food demand. Our estimates suggest that if all lands counted under cultivation in the OECS were used for domestic food needs there will at most be sufficient to feed only one fifth of the OECS population.</t>

                                <t>Many of these elements were included in other proposals by certain delegations from the African Group, which were unsuccessful and would be unlikely to lead to consensus in a Ministerial Declaration. The report by the Working Group on Food Security is yet to be adopted, not because of a lack of political will or commitment among non-proponents, but because one Member insists on legitimizing its policies on direct government-to-government exports.</t>

We note with concern that the category of NFIDCs currently includes large exporters of, inter alia, rice, wheat and wheat flour, hard grains, oilseeds, vegetable oils and sugar, simply because they are net importers. Around 70 Members are included in the category, which is equivalent to 41 per cent of the membership.</t>

                                <t>Like others, we would note that we only received this a couple of days ago, so we are still in the process of reviewing it. I will say that we agree that there is an urgent need to enhance Members agricultural productivity and resiliency, we also agree that there is an urgent need to enhance accessibility of food and we agree that there is a need to enhance transparency of all forms of agricultural trade policy. Of course, the question is how we move from agreeing to those principles to agreeing to tangible outcomes in the agriculture negotiations. Over the past year within the Committee on Agriculture, Members have heard from experts from around the world on the issue of food security and we have discussed Members' own experiences and what we have repeatedly heard from experts was not the need for rolling back WTO rules but rather adherence to the rules and strengthening the rules.</t>

There are other proposals on the table, and we do think that that would be the appropriate place to start this conversation. As I have noted before in an earlier item, we are very keen on the issues and some of the proposals by the LDCs with respect to agriculture and also, we have been very engaged in the work programme, which as Paraguay mentioned there is a report that has not been able to be adopted for the reasons that were explained. We understand the issues and we are keen on working towards a positive resolution to all these issues, but they need to be done in the holistic conversations that we hope to be having in the CoA SS.</t>

However, a number of elements in the proposal are related to the traditional agricultural agenda and thus in our view require discussion in the context of the comprehensive agricultural reform. Nevertheless, our delegation is ready to engage in the future discussion with the African Group on their proposal.</t>

We consider that the document presented by the African Group to be worthy of our further detailed examination. However, it should be noted that some elements, particularly the requested flexibilities are already part of the documents presented at CoA SS.

                                <t>Australia recognizes the dire impact that global food insecurity is having on developing countries, LDCs and NFIDCs, in particular. Action is needed, hence Australia's and the Cairns Group emphasis on the necessity of fundamental reform in agriculture to reduce distortions and to help Members diversify their food supply. The Cairns Group has presented our vision on how to achieve this, a holistic and comprehensive approach to agricultural trade reform in line with Article 20 and hence our submission as others have referred to in JOB/AG/243/Rev.1. The Cairns Group is committed to working with the African Group and other interested WTO Members towards this type of reform. It remains our view that we simply will not reach global food security, development livelihoods and environmental challenges without it. We would take this opportunity to reiterate our view that proposals on agricultural trade reform should go through the relevant Committee for discussions, that being the CoA SS.</t>

The purpose of this draft text is to propose specific measures to effectively and diligently address the challenges constantly faced by developing countries, particularly LDCs, regarding compliance with the SPS standards imposed by importing Members.</t>

                                <t>While the African Group recognizes Members' right to take measures to protect human, animal and plant health, it remains concerned about the rise in SPS measures that are arbitrary and not based on science, as well as the specific challenges faced by developing countries and LDCs in meeting the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of many of their trading partners, with consequences that continue to affect their market access and export competitiveness.</t>

In this connection, the WT/GC/W/914 draft contains provisions that would require all importing countries to enter into consultations, within a reasonable time period, with any exporting developing country or LDC that identifies specific problems in complying with a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that the importing Member has taken or plans to introduce, with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution.</t>

In addition, it is proposed that the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) assist the SPS Committee with interpretation of the SPS standards that are the subject of specific trade concerns.</t>

The proliferation of tariff barriers that create unjustified restrictions to trade, primarily in agricultural products, is evident from the huge number of trade concerns being raised in the WTO subsidiary bodies. In the SPS Committee, some measures clearly fail to meet the requirement of being based on scientific principles and risk assessments. This is especially true of measures adopted by certain developed Members or groups of Members, which have strayed from the science to the point of ignoring their own regulators and taking decisions based purely on political considerations.</t>

We invite the African Group to reach out to the Latin American delegations with a view to moving forward on a revised draft together.</t>

                                <t>Before I conclude, I wish to recall that the SPS Declaration at MC12 has resulted in important work and a report on findings and recommendations, which is still under consideration by the capitals of two delegations, one of which is an African Group member. We call for Members to engage with that delegation so that it can join the consensus, given the African Group's clear and stated interest in these issues, and the report of the working groups of the MC12 Declaration can be presented to ministers in Abu Dhabi.</t>

In other words, mechanisms and procedures are already in place within the SPS Committee to improve the implementation of the SPS Agreement. We therefore urge the relevant discussion to be taken place within the SPS Committee, before the issue being submitted to the General Council.</t>

                                <t>In advocating for the adoption of this decision at MC13, Egypt underscores the critical need to address challenges faced by developing countries, especially LDCs, in adhering to Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) standards imposed by importing members. The proposed decision, outlined in WT/GC/W/914 and G/SPS/W/347, aligns with the parallel approach initiated following the SPS declaration in June 2022. Egypt emphasizes the rising concerns about arbitrary SPS measures lacking scientific basis, disproportionately affecting Developing and Least Developed Countries, impacting their market access and export competitiveness negatively. We support the statement made by Cameroon on behalf of the African Group.</t>

                                <t>This decision calls for a collaborative effort, urging importing countries to engage in timely consultations with developing or LDC exporting countries to find mutually satisfactory solutions for specific SPS compliance challenges. It also encourages developed members to consider the special needs of developing and least developed countries, offering extended timelines upon request, particularly for products of interest. Furthermore, the decision proposes that developed importing members provide non-commercial, preferably free assistance to developing exporting members facing capacity challenges in complying with SPS requirements. Egypt highlights the support from the Codex Alimentarius Commission, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) to interpret SPS standards of specific commercial concern.</t>

                                <t>I deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group, representing the collective voice of 44 members, particularly focusing on the critical issue of technology transfer and diffusion within the framework of the WTO. Recognizing the paramount importance of technology transfer and diffusion in the context of building economic resilience in developing and least developed countries, we acknowledge the transformative power of technology in establishing a modern and technologically advanced industrial base. Technology serves as a catalyst for progress, playing a pivotal role in addressing multifaceted challenges such as food insecurity, pandemics, climate change, and fostering innovation, all of which are fundamental to sustainable development.</t>

                                <t>The declaration proposed builds upon the foundation laid by the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference Declaration in Doha in November 2001, establishing the Working Group on Trade and Transfer of Technology (WGTTT). It is incumbent upon us to further advance this work to ensure that the barriers hindering the facilitation, access, and transfer of technologies to developing and least developed countries are effectively addressed. Considering this, the African Group, proposes that our ministers approve this Declaration/Decision in mC13, the main elements of which are as follows:</t>

We see a growing belief among Members that technology transfer could help to mitigate these challenges.</t>

Accordingly, we wish to express our interest in exploring the relationship that exists between technology transfer and economic development, particularly the role of technology transfer in increasing productivity; technology transfer as a tool for enhancing industrial development and economic diversification; the role of technical assistance and capacity building programmes for developing and least developed countries; and how to enable small and medium sized enterprises in developing and least developed countries to benefit from the various technology transfer tools, instruments and platforms. We are likewise in favour of sharing experiences of technology transfer and trade, and of supplementing and strengthening our work with that of other international organizations, industry and academia.</t>

It is factual that climate change related disasters have increased, and we are likely to witness more and more in the new future.

                                <t>A process point that we want to raise, is that there is no document attached to this item in the agenda. I recognize that earlier this year there were six papers that were presented by the African Group on technology transfer in relation to various aspects of the WTO Agreements. We do not clearly understand if this item in the agenda is related to those documents as there is no document number related; we have also just heard a reference to a draft decision that we do not know about. We need to make these long meetings more useful. More clarity of what we are discussing will help all of us.</t>

                                <t>We thank the African Group for presenting this topic of utmost importance. We would like to highlight that some international commitments made by developing countries in different agreements and organizations may not by fulfilled without the help of specific technologies.

We also welcome Chile's interest as Chair of the Working Group to see it strengthened, including by encouraging Members to submit more proposals – to have more in-depth discussions on this relevant issue. We welcome proposals that will strengthen the Working Group and will make it more relevant within the WTO structure. The idea of perhaps having a discussion that is horizontal and that addresses the different aspects of the bodies makes sense. We have not seen the draft decision yet, so we will wait for a document, so we can express positions that are more in detail. The overall trust of this initiative seems to go in a positive direction.</t>

In this regard, additional evidence-based analysis, as well as exchanging views and sharing experience may be useful in order to gather and discuss evidence and get a better understanding on the relationship between trade and technology transfer. It also seems essential to take into account efforts that are made in other international fora in order to build on existing work rather than duplicate it.</t>

                                <t>Many factors are needed to create real incentives for technology transfer to happen – including the right infrastructure, a conducive business environment, sufficient absorption capacity, and last but not least, a well-functioning, reliable, safe and enforceable regulatory framework, including the protection of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, it is regularly the private sector which is the holder of technology and it will decide on the basis of these and other factors whether and with whom to share its technology. It is therefore paramount that the private sector be involved in subsequent deliberations and experience-sharing activities on the matter.</t>

                                <t>This agenda item is very important. I think there is some confusion on this because this agenda is on the transfer of technology. It emanates from the February retreat on development; after the February retreat on development the African Group came up with a broad proposal in March, which was circulated to various Committees and then in the month of July, they had Committee-specific proposals for technology transfer, there were six proposals, and I hope Cameroon will bear me out, that we are discussing under this agenda those six items, plus the mother proposal of March. Since no links or papers were given, there is confusion, I would request that you take it afresh tomorrow with those six papers, circulated to the Members, so that we can engage in these discussions more effectively. However, if it is not agreeable, then I will just read a one-minute statement, which is the reinvigoration of discussion on technology transfer.</t>

                                <t>We welcome the submissions made by the Africa Group and support it. We hope that a concrete mandate will be delivered in MC13 on these issues. Technology transfer is a priority for us. The WTO recognizes the close relationship between trade and the transfer of technology, as evidenced in the establishment of the Working Group on Trade and Technology Transfer (WGTTT) in 2002. The role of the WGTTT was to discuss ways to increase technology flows from developed to developing countries. The issue of technology transfer is now perhaps more important than ever before, given the central role of development and transfer of environmentally sound technology to address climate change. India's paper JOB/WGTTT/2, also submitted to the Committee on Trade and Environment and Council for TRIPS makes a case for advancing these discussions in the WTO.</t>

                                <t>Opportunities are opening up, especially with a growing commercial activity to develop parts of green technologies in developing countries for technology transfer. As several speakers have highlighted, technology transfer plays and important role in promoting economic development and building resilience. This will be extremely important in the context of decarbonization as well as in various other discussions that we have been having on instruments that are appropriate to promote industrial policy. This can be a powerful tool to breach the developmental gap between countries, as well as to promote sustainable development.</t>

It brings together what we have heard across the various committees, and can identify cross cutting elements and themes so we can continue to discuss this in a constructive spirit.

From the viewpoint of market-mechanism and innovative potential in the private sector, we have a strong reservation on discussions that would lead to any form of forced technology transfer.</t>

                                <t>I have a reform-by-doing proposal to make. We struggled and we really do not know what is going on with this agenda item. First of all, just to stress that we do very much welcome the contributions by the African Group and we agree that this issue of technology transfer is a very important issue, but it was not clear to us whether we are talking about existing papers, which maybe and in which case that is legitimate, or a proposal in which case it would be legitimate if we have seen it with enough time to review it, or whether this is a topic for discussion in which in any case we should be clear and also be able to prepare. So, in that light, my proposal will be that when we have an agenda item, we just have a bit more clarity either from the requester or from somewhere as to what to do because we would like to contribute to this discussion.</t>

                                <t>The reason we introduced this in the July General Council, the reason that the Cairns Group has in mind this statement is because resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems are essential to meeting the goals of global food security and economic development, as well as environmental sustainability. This relationship between trade and sustainability is something we have got to keep working on together. We said at the last GC meeting that we would be pleased to present this statement on the contribution of the multilateral trading system to sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems in document WT/GC/261. We originally submitted this statement at the Committee on Agriculture in September.</t>

                                <t>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to sustainable agriculture. What works in one part of the world does not necessarily work in others. This is an important recognition. Second, we would make the point that measures in the name of environmental sustainability should not be unnecessarily trade restrictive. That is a big fundamental thought behind this piece of paper. Third, unilateral approaches do risk undermining multilateral approach to trade and sustainability. So, this statement underlines that measures need to be based on science, evidence and need to be consistent with WTO Members' obligations as we focus on environmental outcomes. We have been pretty active right across the membership on looking at ways to reconcile trade and environment measures and to avoid unnecessarily trade restrictive import measures. We look forward to further discussions with Members on this issue in the months ahead.</t>

                                <t>The African Group thanks the Cairns Group for their paper. This paper is yet another attempt to reset the agriculture negotiating agenda by pitching a narrative of food security that harps completely on trade liberalization while ignoring Ministerial mandates on critical food security instruments such as PSH and SSM. This would have detrimental effects on developing economies that are disproportionately affected by global food insecurity.</t>

                                <t>We believe Developing countries, which face a greater burden of food insecurity, must themselves decide on the solutions and not have solutions superimposed on them from outside, especially by countries which have commercial/export interest in agriculture rather than a food security perspective. The African Group is of the view that a medium and long-term solution to food security challenges can only be delivered through a MC13 outcome that include substantive food security and livelihoods package with decisions on issues under negotiations in the CoA SS such as PSH, and SSM, as well as outcome on domestic support that addresses the inequitable elements of Domestic Support, trade distorting forms of Green Box and Blue Box. This would foster fair agriculture trading system and allow greater policy space for Developing Countries to support production and livelihoods. These are the outcomes that are necessary for ensuring food security in developing countries and LDCs.</t>

                                <t>We know that reforming the agricultural trade support architecture from the imbalances in the AoA that benefit large agricultural subsidizers, in particularly developed economies, and the substantial reduction in agricultural trade support is central to the reform envisaged under Article 20. However, we believe that it is premature for any Member to call for further market liberalization when our agriculture sector is itself constrained from using necessary tools which are limited by the AoA rules, and also because of the continuation of massive subsidies especially in Developed Countries. The African Group would continue to engage constructively with the Cairns Group and other Members so we can deliver effective WTO solution to Global Food insecurity.</t>

We concur with the Cairns Group that the long-awaited multilateral agricultural trade reform must be progressed as a matter of urgency in a comprehensive manner, consistent with Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture. To promote fair and transparent international agricultural trade, compliance with the relevant WTO Agreements is essential, while recognizing that Members have different and unique agricultural production conditions and practices. Sustainable agriculture is vital for improving food security.</t>

However, we must also reiterate that imposing trade policy measures for environmental purposes may constitute a form of arbitrary discrimination. It may adversely affect agricultural production and trade, especially in developing countries, when such measures are applied unilaterally, without taking into account the fact that multilateral standards, such as the Codex Alimentarius, are in force, and without recognizing other Members' points of views or environmental policies.</t>

We agree with the African Group that advocating further market liberalization is premature while constraints persist due to AoA rules and substantial subsidies in developed countries.

Among these points, my delegation draws attention to the recognition of the agricultural production characteristics and methods unique to each country, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to addressing agricultural sustainability; and the implementation of practices that help agri-food systems adapt to a changing climate, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, eradicate hunger and safeguard global food security, with the participation and leadership of women, Indigenous Peoples and rural communities.</t>

                                <t>China thanks the submission from the Cairns Group. Though as a major agricultural and food net importer, we share many similar views with the group members in promoting sustainable and resilient agricultural and food system. We believe that sustainable agriculture is essential for improving food security, nutrition, economic development, and that environmental policies and outcomes should not be designed for protectionist purpose. We share the increasing concern about the significant surge in the adoption of various forms of unilateral trade-related environmental measures. We agree with the view highlighted in the paper, particularly regarding the potential misuse of trade measures in the pursuit of environment goal and the application of one-size-fits-all approach to Climate Change and mitigation and adaptation.</t>

Under existing rules of AoA, green transition support measures should be encouraged by members for sustainable development while exploring feasible domestic reform modality aiming at leveling the playing field. We hope members could continue to have objective and data-based and science-based discussions in the CTE on the role of agricultural subsidy to the environment, which we believe could be a positive complementary to the agricultural reform and negotiations in CoA SS.</t>

These can allow Developing Countries greater policy space to support product and livelihoods.</t>

                                <t>With regard to Agenda item 16, we thank Australia for presenting the statement, in which Malaysia is also one of the co-sponsors. We wish to stress and reemphasize the importance of a fair, facilitative and transparent agricultural trade system, in the face of global environmental and food security challenges. Sustainable agriculture plays a pivotal role in enhancing food security, fostering economic development and promoting environmental sustainability. As we move forward, it is imperative that our policies promoting sustainable agriculture prioritize long-term sustainability, rather than being driven by protectionist objectives.</t>

                                <t>In this regard, Malaysia wishes to reaffirm our unwavering support for the multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core - upholding WTO principles and agreements, such as the Agreement on Agriculture, TBT and SPS. In our quest of sustainable agricultural trade, we must avoid unjustified trade restrictions and burdensome compliance requirements. Most importantly, we must address the distortionary and harmful effects of global agricultural support, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable global agricultural landscape. In conclusion, we call upon all Members to collaborate and promote sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems, and on this note, Malaysia stands ready to engage constructively with all Members in this crucial agenda.</t>

This statement emphasizes the significance of implementing sustainability measures that are based on scientific evidence, transparent in their implementation, and non-discriminatory in their application. Many of the elements found in the Cairns Group statement are reflected in the COP28 Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, which has garnered the support of 158 countries.</t>

As the OECDs said, agricultural markets are facing a triple challenge providing adequate, affordable, safe, nutritious food for a growing global population. Providing livelihoods all along the food value chain, and at the same time, whilst increasing the sustainability of the agricultural sector. We all need to be thinking about how we align our work across different WTO fora, and wider international fora, and have a serious conversation about sustainability and resilient food systems.</t>

Key to that effort is repurposing the way in which public support is directed towards agriculture to improve the activity, the resilience and sustainability of agricultural practices and systems. So it is absolutely right that we have a serious conversation about sustainability, about resilience of our food systems, here in this Organization, as part of a wider conversation we need to have urgently, about how we use this Organization, and the trading system to support the transition to net zero and save our planet.</t>

                                <t>In this intervention, I would like to cover items 13 and 11, as well as item 16 this morning. On the statement on sustainable, resilient agriculture and food systems presented this morning by Australia from the Cairns Group, New Zealand supports the call for greater dialogue and cooperation on trade-related environment measures at the WTO. This helps us to ensure that our respective efforts to drive more sustainable agriculture and food systems are in line with our WTO commitments and do not pose additional barriers to trade. As others have emphasized, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to environmental sustainability, which have different natural environments and production systems and consequently, will use different approaches and tools to achieving the same outcome of enhanced environmental sustainability. In this regard, New Zealand shares the overall objectives and principles set out in the Cairns Group statement, and looks forward to working with other Members in striving for multilateral coherence in respect to trade-related environmental measures to the WTO.</t>

                                <t>On the earlier item from Singapore (WT/GC/W/908), we recognize the value of enhanced transparency of export restrictions and in particular, the importance of ensuring open, fair and predictable markets, including stable trade flows to net food importing countries, especially LDCs. There have been a number of proposals on export restrictions put forward on the Committee on Agriculture, and we would encourage further deliberations on them in that forum. However, increased transparency is only one leeway to try to address food insecurity, and not the most powerful.</t>

As we outlined previously, in this working group and in the CoA SS, there are many ways to enhance food security and agriculture production within existing rules, and we are open to discussions on these and on the ideas of these papers on those two bodies.</t>

As we highlighted under item 14 on the proposal by the African Group, Costa Rica has systemic and trade concerns about the increase in non-tariff barriers in agricultural trade. Accordingly, we encourage Members to respect the WTO Agreements relating to agriculture and to commit to moving forward decisively with the rules reform, in line with Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture.</t>

To underline two of them: 1) we agree with the statement that sustainable agricultural practices are indispensable to ensure food security and nutrition in the long-term; 2) we welcome the recognition of country-specific contexts and the fact that this means that a one size fits all approach will not bring us forward, as also emphasized by Ambassador Mina.</t>

                                <t>India would like to thank Cairns Group proponents for their proposal. Some of the items in this proposal are contradictory from what we hear from Cairns Group members as well as some of the other Members i.e., five Members who have presented Agenda 16. Let me highlight that contradiction between what we hear and what is written. In 6 out of the 11 items, Cairns Group members have recognized that different Members have unique agricultural production conditions, circumstances and practices and there is no one size fits all approach for improving outcomes in agriculture, but at the same time, the same group of Members have said that no one size fits all, what the group is saying, if done, agriculture negotiation will proceed. Now, how it is unique and how it is different for different countries, I would like to just put some numbers here. If you look at sustainable livelihood in case of India, it is about more than 250 million people are participating in agriculture either as cultivator or agricultural laborers.</t>

                                <t>If I put that number in global context except India, there are maybe three countries - United States, China and Indonesia maybe having more than 250 million population. So, you are talking about a group of people who are doing sustainable cultivation and livelihood support and what could be more sustainable, which is demonstrated in the form of proposal JOB/AG/229 covering 70 per cent of total global population. And asking that one program has delivered as a sustainable program only accept it but please start negotiation. So, I think we need to come clear on things apart from the niceties and love, we should not block such negotiations where actually sustainable livelihood is taking place, and it is helping so many people.</t>

Among these concepts, I would like to point out three that we consider critical:</t>

                                <t>First, the WTO and its rules have contributed positively toward global food security. As Members, we should seek to uphold and build upon these rules to ensure continued and strengthened global food security into the future, which will include mitigating the effects of climate change. Second, the importance of science- and evidence-based measures, allowing for place and scale appropriate sustainable agricultural practices, and avoiding prescriptive approaches that ultimately could undermine the achievement of global sustainability and food security goals.</t>

We look forward to continuing engaging with the Cairns Group and all WTO Members to explore ways that the WTO and its Members can contribute to global food security challenges.</t>

The enormous potential that this Organization facilitating trade can have to change the lives of people all over the world regarding food security. Mozambique is the most important experience I had in my whole career. 36 million hectares of arable land, exactly the same arable land as Argentina. They only do agriculture on 5 million hectares, we do agriculture on 34 million hectares. Therefore, what we do here, beyond papers, is very important because we are changing the lives of people. I think what the Cairns Group is trying to do today is precisely to show that our Article 20-battle is a battle of the future, not a battle of the past. Our responsibility is to put all the elements of the future into something, which is essential and fulfilling our past.</t>

                                <t>What has struck me are the numerous contributions on agriculture and food security. One advantage is sitting back and listening to all of them. It shows a very strong desire in this Council to have an outcome in this area. If you listen there are quite a few similarities in the proposals that have been put forward, as there are differences as well, and I acknowledge that. I want today, on the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, read a quote because I think it will help us with the issue of agriculture. 30 years ago, one of my predecessors Peter Sutherland, who was the Director-General called the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round on 15 December 1993, a defining moment in modern economic and political history. He said, "Today the world has chosen openness and cooperation instead of uncertainty and conflict". He was speaking to the TNC at the time. I wanted to read this to you because I think I sense a spirit of cooperation. There is a moment of cooperation where we can come around and try to get an outcome on agriculture that delivers something for the farmers whom we are all concerned about and set forward a path for the future. That is all I want – let us try to do that. I am hopeful now after listening to all of you. Thank you.</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 17.3-->
                <p>
                    <t>In relation to this item, we would like to reiterate our firm commitment to environmental principles, particularly in the battle against deforestation and forest degradation. We are, however, deeply concerned about the way in which the European regulation addresses these matters. While a more detailed statement will be sent to the Secretariat, in general terms, we urge the European Union to review its unilateral environmental regulations, which are causing poverty and generating tensions among WTO Members. In spite of the discussions that have taken place in the WTO committees, the concerns of the affected countries have not been taken into account, and the WTO General Council is the only option for addressing this issue. The regulation penalizes, diverting attention from the real causes of the problem and shifting responsibility to countries that are less responsible.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 17.4-->
                <p>
                    <t>The key word is therefore "trust". We are faced with institutionally designed trade measures that are regressive and, in our view, have a marginal environmental impact. Those affected by the measures have no protective mechanisms because they are the most vulnerable actors in faraway countries. There are no effective discussion forums that allow for dialogue and truly meaningful constructive cooperation. This situation in which dialogue is impossible undermines trust; it generates reactions and an interest in searching for legal and political alternatives, which unfortunately makes the discussions on environmental provisions in this Organization even more difficult. Creating poverty and penalizing a very specific vulnerable sector, rather than focusing on those that are really responsible, is not the appropriate multilateral path for trade measures that seek to address global environmental problems.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 17.5-->
                <p>
                    <t>For this reason, and in the absence of better mechanisms, we are bringing the discussion before the General Council. While this is an unusual agenda item in that it refers to a specific country, it affects all of us. We urge the European Union and other Members of this Organization to engage in open and sincere discussions on public trade and environmental policy – discussions that are not merely informative, but also effective and cooperative.</t>

                                <t>Peru welcomes and echoes the statement made by Honduras. Exports of the products covered by the regulation account for a significant share of Peru's exports to the European Union. Some of these products, such as cocoa and coffee, have value chains made up of thousands of small-scale producers, whose livelihoods through trade may be impacted by measures such as the one under discussion today. Moreover, for countries like Peru, the European regulation will not only affect trade, but also security policies, specifically with respect to efforts to combat drug production through the substitution of illicit crops.</t>

                                <t>As we have reiterated in other forums, we are concerned that there are still many aspects of the European regulation that remain unclear or require supplementary regulations. This means that the actual time frame that operators have to make the necessary adjustments for compliance will, in reality, be far shorter than the 18-month time frame established by the regulation. Similarly, we note that the regulation fails to specify which documents are required for compliance. It does not define procedural steps or set any fixed time frames, meaning that both operators and the European Union authorities have considerable discretion and that there is, thus, a lack of predictability in the regulatory landscape. The European Union has said that the regulation will be applied as of 30 December 2024. However, we do not when supplementary regulations will be finalized.</t>

                                <t>From our point of view, in addition to asserting that the implementation deadline is non-negotiable, the European Union should provide clarity and certainty about the implementation of all aspects of the regulation. Peru is committed to addressing the threats of climate change, global warming and deforestation, and has therefore implemented strategies and regulations in this area. Of course, we agree with the European Union's objective. However, we believe that in order to achieve this, measures that unnecessarily restrict trade should be avoided.</t>

                                <t>We cannot lose sight of the fact that one of the drivers of deforestation is poverty and a lack of opportunities to earn an income legally. In that context, international trade is certainly a valuable tool that we need to encourage. In our case, cocoa and coffee, which fall within the scope of the European Union's regulation, are crops that currently help thousands of small-scale producers to abandon the illicit crops that fuel drug trafficking. Lastly, we reiterate our request to the European Union to respond in writing to the questions we circulated together with other Members regarding details of the regulation.</t>

Chair, our paper JOB/TE/78/Rev.1 submitted jointly with South Africa highlights our broad concerns with the growing list of environment related trade measures. Despite claiming to make an environmental impact, these measures exclude from design the well-established principles of global environmental law such as common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), respective capabilities and the concept of nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

Specifically in the case of this EU deforestation regulation, we have voiced our concerns both bilaterally as well as here in the WTO. This regulation qualifies as a perfect example of a typical non-tariff measure, blocking the market access of developing countries to the EU market, while providing no evidence that the regulation will meet the intended objectives outlined by the European Union. The regulation in its current form, heavily empowers EU's own economic operators in seeking business critical data from the exporters, disregards efforts being made on afforestation by European Union's trade partners and imposes its own regulatory choices without accounting for the operational conditions prevailing in other countries. The regulation will also harm will also harm segments like women working as farm labor, women entrepreneurs in agriculture, as well as the MSMEs whose interests the European Union apparently seeks to preserve in this Organization.</t>

                                <t>It is important to note that no international agreement calls for the complete conservation of forests in their original forms and sizes. In fact, no country could agree to this. The rezoning of agricultural land as construction plots seen in Europe could thus be challenged, as vegetation is replaced with concrete, notwithstanding regreening initiatives. Consequently, States have undertaken, on the one hand, to manage their forests sustainably and, on the other hand, to work to preserve biodiversity. This includes reforestation, and the management and protection of wetlands. The Regulation also re-examines some provisions of international law.</t>

                                <t>In addition, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism fails to take into account historic contributions of countries to current pollution levels, meaning certain countries and regions such as Africa have a favorable balance. Africa is responsible for less than 5 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions and is home to the world's second-largest forest lung, the Congo Basin. A weighted approach that takes into account common but differentiated responsibilities is not only fair, but also consistent with the foundations of international environmental law. The African Group remains open to any new meaningful discussions or constructive and transparent deliberations.</t>

The majority of these products are exported by LDCs. This EU regulation and the strict and unclear criteria of its benchmarking mechanism and due diligence process risk restricting LDC access markets and endangering LDC economies that depend on export of these products leading to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase in poverty in LDCs.

The Dominican Republic is concerned about the actions under the European Union's Green Deal, which consists of a package of cross-cutting measures covering all economic and trade activities. It is important, however, to note that the actions are intended to contribute to a green transition that will benefit its citizens and contribute to the global ecosystem, which we welcome. However, the initiatives must be compatible with WTO Agreements.</t>

                                <t>In this connection, the Dominican Republic reiterates its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, the preservation of ecosystems, and environmental sustainability good practices. We invite the European Union to initiate a dialogue on trade and sustainable development, with a focus on trade facilitation, thereby jointly advancing the goal of more transparent, resilient and participatory international trade. The countries that co-sponsored the document submitted to the General Council account for around 15 per cent of the European Union's imports, and we therefore urge other Members to participate in the dialogue as well. We are of the opinion that the regulation that the European Union intends to implement would have an adverse impact on Dominican exports to the European market, which were valued at over USD 300 million in 2022. For this reason, we fear that meeting the objectives of the European Green Deal may undermine the gains made in relation to fair trade and other economic benefits between the European Union and developing countries in the framework of the WTO and trade-related Economic Partnership Agreements. The European Union's pursuit of environmental objectives introduces legal discretion, uncertainty and unpredictability for our exporters, as well as more complex conditions and requirements for exports from developing countries.</t>

An overarching concern for us is the impact of the regulation on the capacity of smallholder producers in our countries to comply with higher export standards and information requirements. This could lead to exclusion of smallholders and Indigenous peoples and local communities from high-value supply chains, due to their lack of resources and know-how to comply, which would have adverse consequences for global progress with respect to the achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 10 and others.</t>

                                <t>We believe that the implementing acts, regulations and guidelines need to provide adequate protection against not only exclusions of smallholders, but protection of the rights of local communities to manage and restore forests, and protection against inadvertently exacerbating land tenure security issues and/or any human-rights risks in developing country producer regions. Such protections would ensure that the European Union regulation does not unintentionally exacerbate global deforestation, contrary to the regulation's goals. The regulation is expected to shrink supply chains to improve traceability. This may have the unintentional consequence of expanding large scale agriculture at the expense of small- scale, leading to greater land conflicts as well.</t>

                                <t>A just transition to sustainable global supply chains requires inclusivity, especially for smallholders in developing countries. This, in turn, requires greater regulatory incentives for operators and traders to involve smallholders. Countries placed in 'higher' risk category, in turn, require adequate support to transition to sustainable practices, including through funding and development co-operation programmes, such as that of European Union's Forest Partnerships. Therefore, we support the call by the co-sponsors for the provision of assistance measurable to what the European Union provides domestically.</t>

We believe that the urgency of the triple climate crisis requires the WTO to strengthen and deepen its analysis of how trade can and must help tackle the crisis, but in the least restrictive manner possible. In our view, this should be done through discussions on wide-ranging topics. We welcome the communication submitted on this issue. We are examining its substance, and we will continue to follow the matter very closely as part of the discussions on trade and environment both in this Council and in the CTE.</t>

But there is no way the European Union can assure how to ascertain the registration of such commercial plantations, not indigenous plantations. So, we look forward to continuing the discussion on this matter and we would like to seek more clarification from the European Union, particularly on the implementation.</t>

We reject the application of any unilateral measure that has a negative impact on the multilateral trading system, particularly on developing Members and LDCs. We share the Latin American group's concern about the regulation in question, which is a clear example of a unilateral measure that regulates production in third countries, selects a one-size-fits-all type of solution, is the result of insufficient dialogue and creates tensions between multilateral trade and environmental regimes. We wish to reiterate that the WTO has proved to be an organization that is primarily guided by economic considerations and sound legal rules. The very definition of unilateralism implies conduct that violates principles and rules. In this connection, we call for a return to multilateralism as the best way to resolve our differences and we express our support for a forward-looking, transparent and inclusive multilateral trading system founded on consensus-based rules.</t>

                                <t>I would like to echo the statement made by Ambassador Castillo. With regard to decarbonization, we are the first oil-producing country to join the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, and our environmental goals are very ambitious. With regard to deforestation, we reduced deforestation by 70 per cent last year. However, despite this, we will be assessed and, regardless of the result, our most vulnerable exporters will have to meet requirements that will increase their costs and limit their options. Therefore, although we are advancing more quickly, being more ambitious and seriously discussing fossil fuels and other issues, our producers will still be penalized.</t>

We have all made the commitment, under the Sustainable Development Goals, to halt deforestation by 2020. Clearly, this has not been achieved. And that is why 143 producer and consumer countries including the European Union pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 as part of the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use. If we want to achieve this goal, we need to act. And with continued alarming rates of deforestation globally – we need to act now.</t>

The European Union contributes to deforestation by consuming a significant share of products associated with deforestation and forest degradation. We therefore have the responsibility to contribute to more sustainable value chains and foster more sustainable consumption, production, and trade. But we also understand we cannot do it alone. We are committed to implementing the Deforestation Regulation in a spirit of close partnership, transparency, and open dialogue. This is why we have closely engaged with all Members, when preparing the Regulation. And why we have intensified these efforts once the Regulation was adopted.</t>

                                <t>As indicated in the Agenda of the General Council, and following the transparent, inclusive, and open nature of the IFD initiative, this item has been requested to inform all WTO Members of the following: First, that WTO IFD participants have finalized the English text of the IFD Agreement, after completing its legal review. This text, which was circulated to all WTO Members in document INF/IFD/W/52 on 27 November 2023, constitutes a major achievement for IFD participants; who are currently completing the review of the French and Spanish versions; Second, IFD participants intend to make a request in due course to add the IFD Agreement to Annex 4 of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO, that is, as an open-ended plurilateral agreement; participants are still working on when to make the request, if early at MC13, and, Third, to achieve such incorporation, we wish to engage with all WTO Members with a view to garnering consensus for the IFD Agreement to produce its pro-development benefits.</t>

                                <t>Let me briefly inform the Membership about key elements and implications of the IFD Agreement: Investment facilitation in the WTO is the natural consequence of the growing inter-dependency between trade and investment, together with their potential for promoting economic growth and development. Attracting not only more, but also more sustainable investment, is fundamental especially for developing and LDC Members to upgrade and diversify their production and exports, develop digital infrastructure, encourage technology transfer and innovation, and facilitating their integration into global value chains. Investment facilitation is then critical especially in the current polycrisis. The focus of the IFD Agreement is not on changing participants' investment policies in substance, but on making such investment policies more transparent and investment-related administrative procedures, more streamlined and efficient.</t>

                            <p>
                                <t>According to several surveys, this is where investors and businesses most want to see investment reforms. In that sense, the IFD Agreement can contribute to make the WTO more responsive to the needs of the global economy, governments, as well as domestic and foreign economic operators. Providing special and differential treatment, including technical assistance and support for capacity building, to developing and least-developed country participants is a key component of the IFD Agreement. The IFD Agreement provides that the extent and timing of implementation of its provisions shall be related to the capacities of developing and LDC participants. In addition, developing countries and LDCs have the possibility to undertake a Needs Assessment to be better prepared for implementation, including by identifying capacity building support needs.</t>

                                <t>Cambodia takes the floor to acknowledge and appreciate the milestone and significant progress of the negotiations on the IFD Agreement, starting from a joint statement initiative in December 2017 and eventually concluded final text in November 2023. This has been a notable achievement of the negotiation exercise at the WTO. There should be more productive activity like this in the organization. With the negotiations amongst over 110 participating WTO Members at all levels of development, held in a transparent and inclusive manner since September 2020, we believe that the IFD will contribute to creating a more transparent, efficient, and predictable environment to facilitate not only more investment, but also more sustainable investment, as well as to support for our domestic, bilateral, and regional reform efforts.</t>

                                <t>As an LDC, Cambodia has participated in the negotiations and will continue to support the IFD Agreement. This is because we are in needs of development for our future prosperity. We take every moment to think and act upon how we can best harvest the benefits from this organization through collective efforts from WTO Membership. We see the IFD as one of the best examples of development goals to attract more investment and firms into the country, create more jobs for local people, strengthen our competitiveness and fully integrate ourselves into the multilateral trading system.</t>

In July, a vast majority of Members concluded negotiations on the text of the Agreement on Investment Facilitation for Development. The conclusion of the negotiations on this commercially meaningful agreement demonstrate that the WTO can indeed deliver results that would foster inclusive growth, create more jobs, and widen the circle of prosperity.

                                <t>The IFD agreement is such that would foster closer international cooperation at the global level and create a more transparent, efficient, and predictable environment that will underpin cross-border flow of investment for the development. We believe it would complement our ongoing efforts towards unlocking opportunities in our economy. We are also of the view that the WTO should be responsive to the economic priorities of its members in this 21st century for the institution to remain relevant. MC13 should recognize this remarkable achievement and set in motion the process of integrating the Agreement on Investment Facilitation for Development into the WTO legal architecture.</t>

As an LDC, attracting foreign direct investment and fostering economic growth pose unique challenges. We firmly believe the IFD Agreement will enable us to harness the advantages of the multilateral trading system and will be a blueprint that will ultimately pave the way for sustainable development.

Successful implementation will not only demonstrate Liberia's commitment to stability, but also unlock its potential to attract investments that spur economic growth and job creation, further bolstering its reputation as a trustworthy and reliable trade partner. Therefore, we call on all Members to join us in endorsing the incorporation of the IFDA Agreement into Annex 4 of the Marrakesh Agreement at the upcoming 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13). This crucial step will unlock its transformative potential and make the final Ministerial Decision by consensus.</t>

                                <t>Investment facilitation lies at the center of Brazil's approach both to international investment agreements, since we developed our model of Cooperation and Investment Facilitation Agreements in 2012, as an alternative to the traditional BIT model focused on investment protection disciplines and the ISDS mechanism. Since 2015, Brazil has signed 14 bilateral and regional investment agreements with trading partners from developing and least developed countries. Investment facilitation has also been a driving force behind domestic reforms, implemented over the last years, to improve the transparency, predictability, and efficiency of our business and investment climate.</t>

We are of the view that the centrality of the development dimension in the JSI on IFD is, to a large extent, a result of the active role played by developing countries throughout the negotiations as coordinators, small group facilitators, and proponents.</t>

                                <t>First, we welcome the communication by Chile and Korea, and we support it. It will be a significant contribution to update the WTO rulebook and deliver concrete benefits. Second, the communication represents the collective will of vast majority of Members to integrate this JSI into the WTO architecture. At a time when the MTS is under stress, it is noteworthy that this JSI enjoys widespread support with close to 120 Members from different regions and development status. Singapore looks forward to more WTO Members joining this pro-development initiative. The JSI on IFD contains sound governance principles on investment authorization procedures, which will help developing and LDC Members attract stronger FDI flows and boost economic development.</t>

I do not wish to try to repeat or sell the benefits of the IFDA, as the support shown by more than two thirds reflects the importance of this Agreement - despite all differences and divergencies in other areas. Like other participants, to us, we wish to see this Agreement be implemented as Annex 4 under Marrakesh Agreement, which is doable with the consensus of the membership. We therefore urge all Members to consider supporting this request as we strongly believe that this Agreement will benefit all of us. The last thing we want to see is that benefits cannot be materialized due to procedural issues.</t>

IFD was also discussed by G20 trade and investment Ministers. In the WTO, more and more members have shown their support to the IFD. Currently 117 members have joined the IFD. And more members are coming on broad. For the non-participants, some are favorably considering it, pending domestic procedures, while others would not oppose adding the IFD Agreement into Annex 4 of the WTO Agreement. Through recent collective outreach efforts, it is clear that the vast majority of non-participants can bless the IFD. Counting these Members, the IFD agreement is either participated or blessed by at least over 95 per cent of WTO Members.</t>

                                <t>The broad support and engagement from a diverse range of the WTO members underscore the importance of IFD, in particular its role of attracting FDI to make up for the investment deficit faced by developing members. It could help the WTO meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Investment Facilitation for Development, as its name implies, is a development-oriented agreement, with four distinctive developmental dimensions. First, it is an agreement that was initiated and launched by a group of developing members and widely supported by members from all regions and levels of development. Second, it is an agreement that developing members have made substantial contributions, with two-thirds of text-based proposals either came from, or were co-sponsored by, developing or LDC members. Third, it is an agreement with a dedicated development chapter, embodying elements of S&amp;DT, need assessment, technical assistance, and capacity building. Fourth, it is an agreement that is conducive to increase industrial production capacity and diversification and could provide for the exact kind of policy space and business environment that are needed by the developing countries for economic growth and transformation.</t>

                                <t>The Philippines thanks co-coordinators for the updates and for bringing us where we are today. The objectives of the IFD were clear from the beginning – it increases transparency and facilitates procedures for investments. As Foreign Direct Investments greatly contribute to generating much needed jobs in my country, and as more Philippine businesses are exploring opportunities abroad, the future IFDA makes it easier for global investors to understand investment regulations and bring business to those countries that need them.</t>

                                <t>More importantly, the IFDA is a development-focused agreement, as it offers a dedicated section on Special and Differential Treatment. It has a section on Sustainable Investments, encouraging responsible business conduct. In addition, the WTO Secretariat, in cooperation with international organizations are conducting needs assessment exercises to ensure all participants can effectively implement the Agreement.</t>

                                <t>We thank Chile and the Republic of Korea for adding this important item to today's agenda. My delegation has been part of this initiative since 2019. Ecuador has participated actively in this process. Investment facilitation is a tool that complements and supports our national efforts to promote and attract investment, which is crucial to achieving the objectives of our National Development Plan. Investment is a cross cutting issue that also covers trade. We have heard on many occasions across this Organization about the need to channel investments to improve international trade infrastructure, as well as other aspects of a productive nature.</t>

                                <t>How do we intend to encourage fuller participation in international trade, especially for small and vulnerable economies, as well as for least developed countries? Without the necessary and appropriate investment to achieve this objective, international cooperation, technical assistance and capacity building, though substantial elements, have their limitations, in particular with respect to infrastructure. In this connection, Ecuador believes that investment facilitation is a catalyst for promoting economic growth and sustainable development. Once again, we thank Chile and the Republic of Korea for this item and the work carried out on this important issue.</t>

The Agreement is a valuable tool, with the potential to facilitate foreign investment flows between countries. The support from the WTO Secretariat and the harmonious work of Ambassador Boza of Chile and Ambassador Park of Korea are exemplary and have paved the way for endorsement by 117 WTO Members. The Agreement will make it possible to implement innovative provisions, improving the levels of transparency and predictability of measures, streamlining and speeding up procedures to facilitate investment, and enhancing cross-border cooperation, information sharing and the adoption of best practices. It also includes the promotion of sustainable development as a means to encourage the uptake by investors and enterprises of responsible practices. Special and differential treatment is an essential element of the Agreement, including technical assistance and support for capacity building. Foreign investment is an important factor for economic and social development, contributing to poverty reduction, job creation, technology transfer, as well as the expansion and diversification of productive capacity and trade. For that reason, we are excited about the expected benefits of the Agreement, especially for developing and least developed countries.</t>

It can contribute to more consistent and predictable investment environment which is attractive to investors. It is important that the agreement ensures that the unique needs and challenges of developing countries and LDC are addressed properly in particular the needs to provide for support for technical assistance and capacity building. In conclusion, let me emphasize that it is very important that WTO Members commit themselves to establishing sufficiently large technical assistance and capacity-building programs to assist developing and LDCs in the implementation. The outcome of the negotiations is a key to put developing countries, and especially LDCs, in a position to benefit as much as possible from the IFDA.</t>

India would like to thank the coordinators for submitting this proposal and if you recall day before yesterday, there was a specific clarification or question from India, whether this proposal is coming for information. It was said that yes, it is coming for information and chair you also said that your view is also that it is for information. I thank all the respondents or the proponents who have spoken on this topic. I would like to take some of us back in memory and I am sure those who were here in 2017, during the May General Council meeting may be aware of the historical facts of this subject. There are four things to recall.</t>

                                <t>One is what we call July 2004 framework. This I would like to place on record as part of our statement. The document number WT/L/579 of 2 August 2004, which is covering that July framework and that is the July 2004 GC decision which actually give a negative mandate - negative forget non-mandated, it gave a negative mandate to this topic. Then we come to Nairobi Ministerial which was not in WTO context, not very distant. It was in 2015, eight years back. The paragraph 34 of Nairobi Ministerial declaration - I would again like to put that on record as part of my statement. I will not repeat those paragraphs or those documents. Paragraph 34 of Nairobi Ministerial declaration again continued the negative mandate. I am not saying non-mandated issues but negative mandate of Ministers not to have negotiations on this subject.</t>

So, this is the third document which I would like to place on record as part of my statement, giving the background of this topic and the last document which, I would like to quote is the document presented by Namibia, South Africa and India, which is WT/GC/W/819/Rev.1 that is the legal status of JSIs. I will not get into the substance of this agreement, and I will only talk about the process. As per the provisions of Article III.2 and Article X of the Marrakesh Agreement, any new disciplines, needing discussions require agreements of all WTO Members.</t>

In that response, if we read the minutes of that meeting, some of the proponents who have spoken today, several countries stated that informal dialogue is only aimed at information sharing instead of negotiation. Further, India was asked to allow the agenda that it was not a proposal to start any negotiations. They were taking this opportunity to inform other Members of an informal process they wanted to initiate.</t>

                                <t>I will be brief. I was not planning on intervening on this, but I must. As you all know the United States is not a participant of this initiative, but we welcome the initiative and we have said that before. I will say that, listening here, particularly to many Members with who are participating in this, who we really hear from, it is really heartening, and it goes to why we are here. While, again, we are not part of it, we welcome that it has been concluded, the intention of putting it in an Annex 4, as I have said this before, we have no objection to that, even though we are not participating. Since we do not have much time, obviously this is a conversation that needs to continue.</t>

                                <t>We disagree with the paper that was put on the table some time ago by South Africa, India and Namibia, on their interpretation of the JSI's and whether they are consistent or not with the WTO Agreement; we do believe that the WTO system does provide for and can sustain plurilateral initiatives. This is how we can make progress. I said here yesterday, we had a conversation about technology transfer, this is part of that conversation, having a healthy and transparent regulatory system, whether it is for investment of otherwise is part of what creates the enabling ecosystem for voluntary technology transfer. So again, we welcome that from that perspective and if you believe that we need to have conversations about that topic, then we do certainly think that investment facilitation and transparency, which is what this is about, belongs in the system. I just wanted to add those thoughts, I did not have anything prepared but wanted to be clear on that.</t>

I believe that information sharing today in this General Council marked a very good start.</t>

I am especially proud that the negotiating process has been – from start to finish – open and transparent while never losing sight of our shared development goals. Now, we turn to the task of bringing the benefits of this high-quality product to all members and the global economy. We look forward to engaging with each one of you who may have questions, advice, or frank concerns, with the goal of achieving a rare and significant milestone in Abu Dhabi.

The WTO could and should play a more prominent role in ensuring the mutual supportiveness of trade regimes and environment regimes and in deliberating concrete multilateral trade solutions to respond to global environmental challenges and foster sustainable development. In this regard, we are greatly encouraged by the revitalized discussions in the Committee on Trade and Environment pursuant to MC12 mandate. A large number of proposals were submitted, transparency and experience sharing exercises were carried out and a first thematic session on trade and energy transition was held on the reform by doing basis.</t>

                                <t>First, a strong political commitment to multilateral cooperative approaches to address global environmental challenges, including reiterating the principles among others that "measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade". Second, setting up a multilateral mechanism such as a standing Agenda item in CTE for enhancing multilateral deliberative functions on environment-related trade measures and environmental measures affecting trade. Such agenda could include the following elements: (i) enhance the transparency and deliberation of environment-related trade measures and environmental measures affecting trade through structured and informative dialogue among Members, to allow meaningful exchange of views on policy designs, attend to the environmental affects and potential market access impact, particularly on developing countries. (ii) examine the interplay between international trade and environmental laws, to ensure a coherent, mutually supportive and harmonious rapport between international trade and environmental policies. (iii) identify policy instruments within the mandate of the WTO that can support members' efforts on combating environmental challenges and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including for example trade liberalization and facilitation for the deployment of environmental goods and services, advancement for facilitation to foster green supply chains and green trade, technology transfer and diffusion to accelerate energy transition or other relevant policy tools with a special focus on development dimensions.</t>

                                <t>Colombia supports the comments made by China under this agenda item and aligns itself with China's statement. We would also like to add the following. Multilateral environmental fora are probably the most important fora in the world at this time. The three fundamental environmental conventions, in addition to their respective conferences of the parties (COP) and the agreements resulting from them, are the keys to a common and shared future. Within these forums, they assess the situation and the main causes of environmental problems, prioritize some activities over others and negotiate the balances and the ways in which the main objectives should be met.</t>

                                <t>We see relatively little of this at the WTO. We focus on our usual tools with a certain disconnection from the overall picture. We discuss existing trade measures that have an impact on the environment, but often overlook the fact that there are other measures that are deemed to be much more important and that there are different, negotiated ways of doing things. It does not necessarily have to be this way. Here at the WTO, we could start by carrying out joint and periodic reviews of the findings made, and agreements reached at the environmental COPs.</t>

                                <t>This is a necessity, including from a legal standpoint. The rules of public trade law cannot be considered in "clinical isolation" from the rules of public environmental law, as was stressed by the Appellate Body in US — Gasoline. This means that WTO rules must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent and in harmony with other areas of law and, first and foremost, with international environmental law. The conclusions reached within the environmental forums, the priorities agreed, the fundamental principles governing both spheres and the negotiated ways of doing things cannot be ignored, as they are an integral part of our rule book.</t>

                                <t>Within the WTO, we have entered into a somewhat controversial and complex discussion on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which has generated significant opposition. However, we are of the view that this point is just one aspect of a much bigger picture. We should enhance our discussions by using all of the principles, findings, conclusions, priorities and agreements established within the environmental forums. Perhaps we are the ones who should adapt to them, rather than applying unilateral trade measures that fail to take adequate account of what has been achieved in these forums' negotiations.</t>

                                <t>In addition, despite the major difficulties, the discussions within environmental forums are conducted in a much more cooperative way that recognizes important nuances. I will give some examples, all of which are taken from statements made by large delegations. In environmental forums, they recognize that the subsidization of certain activities has significant adverse environmental effects, whereas, here, in the main forum for discussing subsidies, we prefer to refrain from talking seriously about limiting them. In environmental forums, they recognize that energy goals must take into account energy poverty, whereas, here, we ignore arguments about poverty and opt instead for unilateral trade measures that have a particular impact on the most vulnerable. In environmental forums, they say that we need to grant more support to the developing world, including technology and technology transfer, whereas, here, we say that it is not something to be spoken about. In environmental forums, they work on the basic premise that we should set environmental goals and see how each country can contribute based on its capacity, whereas, here, we discuss one-size-fits-all measures that are imposed from above. In environmental forums, they recognize that developed countries need to move faster, whereas, here, we deny the existence of certain principles and of common but differentiated responsibilities in particular.</t>

                                <t>It is not, therefore, just a legal or logical necessity. We truly need to familiarize ourselves with the environmental forums, to improve our discussions with them and to learn from their positions. The WTO has made some important, albeit tentative, progress in this regard. The Trade Day at COP28, supported by the Director-General and the Secretariat, is good news. The revitalization of the Committee on Trade and Environment, under the leadership of Ecuador, is good news. The discussions and documents on environmental principles, including the forum promoted by Colombia during the Public Forum, are good news. While the study proposed by the Chief Economist on carbon pricing based on environmental principles appeared to be good news, we are yet to see this study despite the fact that it was announced more than nine months ago.</t>

                                <t>These pathways for improved discussions between both spheres need to be strengthened and, above all, maintained. The WTO cannot deny or ignore what is happening in the most important multilateral forums of our time. The WTO cannot and should not be a silo and should strive to remain in step with the progress that our own countries are making in multilateral environmental forums.  We apologize for the fact that we have not submitted documents at this stage. It is partly because we wanted to hear about and highlight the progress and most significant interventions made at the recent COP28, which ended just a couple of days ago, precisely as part of this deliberative exercise among forums that we are proposing.</t>

We will continue to work closely with other delegations in this area, including with a view to possible outcomes at MC13.</t>

                                <t>Increasing recourse to trade related climate and environment measures also made in depth multilateral discussions on these matters urgent, in order to limit their negative trade effects, to ensure that they do not constitute arbitrary or disguised restrictions or unjustifiable discrimination in international trade, while ensuring their compliance with both international trade and environment law. Considering that countries carry out different climate policies within the context of their own national conditions and development levels, we believe that a holistic perspective and a transparent basis should be created in which heterogeneous climate policies can be compared and eventually aligned, also taking into account needs of sustainable development.</t>

We advocate for the initiation of multilateral discussions, within the framework of the CTE mandate, concerning environment-related trade measures and their implications for market access especially on developing and least developed countries. These discussions should prioritize supporting developing countries and LDCs through capacity building, financial assistance, and proper technology transfer programs and initiatives. The objective should be to mitigate the adverse effects, particularly those stemming from unilateral measures, on their market shares and promote sustainable development and multilateral solutions. MC13 presents an opportune moment to launch such a discussion.</t>

These measures should be transparent and should take into consideration the diverse level of development of member states and capacity constraints of developing countries and LDCs. These measures should avoid creating unnecessary or disguised barriers to trade flows and market access, especially for developing countries, to help them increase their share in international trade, as recognized in paras. 1 and 2 of the Marrakesh agreement.</t>

We welcome efforts to revitalize the CTE but also see the need to apply a sustainability lens across the organization, in technical work of Committees and in enhanced cross-Committee collaboration. The Philippines holds that the WTO would stand to benefit from pursuing greater complementarity with other multilateral processes and MEAs. In this respect, the Global Stock take calls on members to promote "a supportive and open international economic system…noting that measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade." We stand to benefit in examining how the WTO can positively contribute to our collective environmental goals and call for a commensurate level of ambition at MC13 that was shown at COP28.</t>

Two comments: We support a strong political commitment to multilateral cooperative approaches coming out of MC13 and strengthening further the role of the CTE in this regard. A deliberative discussion in the CTE must take into regard also the need for environmental measures and the right to regulate. Ambitious multilateral action would reduce the need for unilateral measures.</t>

Although the respective legal regimes of trade and environment must be seen in conjunction, we should be careful not to "import" principles and concepts from one regime to the other, since they have been developed in distinct political contexts. We should avoid increasing the level of polarization. Before closing, let me just add that it would have been helpful for the discussion if there had been a document circulated before the meeting.</t>

                                <t>They should aim to foster a more rigorous analysis of emerging policies and evidence. Members, with stakeholders' support, can and should take time to explore what good policy design could look like. We also wish to emphasis the bottom-up, pragmatic work on trade policy solutions. This is the key added value of the CTE and we seek to not duplicate the existing WTO functions and the work that is done elsewhere.</t>

An outcome that builds on progress made since MC12, an outcome that provides concrete guidance to our future work up to MC14 and an outcome that is conducive to turn multilateral discussions into collective and cooperative trade actions. As I already mentioned, the global environmental challenges are real. MC13 is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss.

                    <t>REVIEW OF THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED UNDER PARAGRAPH 3 OF GATT 1994 (WT/L/1165, WT/L/1178)</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 20.1-->
                <p>
                    <t>The Chairperson said that paragraph 3(a) of GATT 1994 provides an exemption from Part II of GATT 1994 for measures under specific mandatory legislation – enacted by a Member before it became a contracting party to GATT 1947 – which prohibits the use, sale or lease of foreign-built or foreign-reconstructed vessels in commercial applications between points in national waters or waters of an exclusive economic zone.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 20.2-->
                <p>
                    <t>She further noted that in 1994, the United States had invoked this provision with respect to specific legislation that met the requirements of that paragraph. Paragraph 3(b) of GATT 1994 calls for a review of this exemption five years after the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement – and thereafter every two years for as long as the exemption is in force – to examine whether the conditions for the exemption still prevail.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 20.3-->
                <p>
                    <t>The General Council last considered this matter at its meeting in March 2023. She noted at the time that statements, questions and responses from interested delegations and the United States, together with the annual reports provided by the United States, circulated in WT/L/1165 and WT/L/1178, would form the basis for this year's review. The General Council had also agreed that it would consider this matter again at the last meeting of the year in 2023.This exemption was without prejudice to solutions concerning specific aspects of the legislation covered by this exemption negotiated in sectoral agreements or in other fora.</t>

                                <t>The United States confirms that the conditions that created the need for this exemption continue to exist, including the US Navy's reliance on commercial shipyards for day-to-day maintenance of naval and surge-fleet vessels. It also remains critical for US shipbuilders to build commercial ships for trade in order to ensure the maintenance of a viable industrial base to meet future US naval requirements.</t>

Our focus is as always on the salient point of paragraph 3(b) of the GATT agreement, whether the conditions, which created the need for the exemption, still exist. This question seems even more relevant when considering the fact that the Jones Act has been in effect for more than 103 years.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson said that there were a number of sub-items under this agenda item. In this regard, she started by noting that the draft waiver decisions for the matters listed in sub-items 21(A) to 21(E) which had been taken up for consideration by the Council for Trade in Goods at its meeting on 30 November. For those items, the Chairperson invited the Chairperson of the Goods Council to report to the General Council.</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 21.3-->
                <p>
                    <t>I would like to report that, at its meeting of 30 November – 1 December 2023, the Council for Trade in Goods considered five collective waiver requests of extensions to the introduction of Harmonized System changes for 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022 into WTO Schedules of Concessions, which are based on similar waivers currently in force that will expire on 31 December 2023. The Council approved the draft decisions contained in documents G/C/W/831, G/C/W/832, G/C/W/833, G/C/W/834 and G/C/W/835/Rev.1. The five draft decisions that are being put forward today for consideration by the General Council have followed the procedures provided for in Article IX:3 (b) of the Marrakesh Agreement and are contained in the documents listed in the Airgram of today's meeting. Finally, I would like to note that, at its November meeting, the CTG recommended that the five draft waiver decisions contained in these documents be forwarded to the General Council for adoption.</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 21.4-->
                <p>
                    <t>The Chairperson proposed that, in accordance with the Decision-Making Procedures under Articles IX and XII of the WTO Agreement agreed in November 1995 (WT/L/93), the General Council adopt these five draft Decisions referred to by the CTG Chairperson in his report.</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 21.6-->
                <p>
                    <t>The Chairperson recalled that, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article IX of the WTO Agreement, "any waiver granted for a period of more than one year shall be reviewed by the Ministerial Conference not later than one year after it is granted, and thereafter annually until the waiver terminates." She noted that there were seven waivers before the General Council for review, as listed under sub-item (f) in the proposed Agenda. She also recalled that these waivers had already been agreed by the General Council and that they were in force. Therefore, the General Council was not expected to take any new decision on their renewal or otherwise at this meeting. She further noted that five of the waivers under review provide that an annual report should be submitted by the Members concerned. The reports from these Members had been circulated in documents WT/L/1179 from Cuba, and WT/L/1173 – 1176 from the United States.</t>

As we would have stated before, the United States remains the region's largest export market and a valuable trading partner, and CBERA is of significant economic importance to CARICOM. The programme provides opportunities to expand trade between the United States and beneficiary CARICOM countries, thereby promoting the growth of economic development and opportunity in the Region. As small and vulnerable economies, CARICOM countries place significant value in this programme and we are appreciative of this continued support by the United States.</t>

                                <t>We align with the statement by the CARICOM Group. We also thank the United States for its presentation and report. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) plays a vital role in the trade and economic development of OECS countries. In the past two years, four of six OECS WTO Members registered a growth in their exports to the US under CBERA. Nonetheless, it is concerning that exports are markedly down compared to a decade ago for all OECS WTO Members. This is largely representative of wider structural constraints in our economies, many of them brought on by exogenous factors. We shudder to think of what the state of exports would have been in the absence of programmes such as CBERA, notwithstanding the structural challenges. This further underscores the need for these kinds of programmes and for dedicated attention by the entire membership to provide the necessary policy space geared towards improving the terms of trade for developing Members. Again, we thank the United States for its update and look forward to continuing to build on this important trade and economic relationship with the United States.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson said that the CTD Chairperson would provide the General Council with a report on the CTD's consideration of the report of the Joint Advisory Group on the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO. She then invited the CTD Chairperson to report on this matter.</t>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <t>Ambassador Sánchez-Fung (Dominican Republic), Chair of the Committee on Trade and Development, delivered the following report:</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.3-->
                <p>
                    <t>The ITC's Joint Advisory Group held its 57th Session on 20 July 2023. The report on that meeting is contained in document ITC/AG(57)/292. The report was presented to the CTD at its 122nd Session on 17 November by the Chairperson of the Joint Advisory Group, Ambassador Nadia Theodore of Canada. Ambassador Theodore noted that, in an ever-evolving global trade landscape, the ITC has rightfully maintained its focus on empowering small businesses to compete in regional and global markets. Its added value is clear: the ITC presents practical and innovative solutions that small firms can use to navigate these uncertainties and build greater resilience.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.4-->
                <p>
                    <t>At the Joint Advisory Group meeting, delegations shared their perspectives on the pressing needs of countries grappling with fragility, uncertainty, and the post-pandemic recovery. What came through, loud and clear, was the importance of finding ways to connect with new markets, especially through digital platforms. Delegations recognized the ITC's role in facilitating the transfer of technology, providing market intelligence, and empowering small businesses to access and thrive in online marketplaces.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.5-->
                <p>
                    <t>It was appreciated that the ITC's value lies in its collaboration with national and international partners to identify key stakeholders and needs in beneficiary countries, adhere to global best practices, and address local challenges while navigating the intricacies of international markets.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.6-->
                <p>
                    <t>Delegations also expressed appreciation for the ITC's commitment to inclusivity and poverty reduction. The ITC's focus extends beyond merely finding new opportunities for small businesses; the organization is equally committed to ensuring that women, youth, refugees, and vulnerable communities are driving MSMEs' participation in the global economy.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.7-->
                <p>
                    <t>The SheTrades Hubs were particularly commended for providing a unique platform that encompasses training, tools, and networking opportunities to boost the competitiveness of women-led businesses. As the ITC's evaluation unit noted, these hubs are a key factor in enhancing the ITC's efficiency and effectiveness. They do so by establishing partnerships with local institutions and enabling outreach to a larger number of small businesses led and owned by women. This partnership-driven model, as a result, drives scalability to ensure maximum impact.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.8-->
                <p>
                    <t>Appreciation was also expressed for the dedication of ITC staff. This dedication extends to internal change management. The ITC Moving Forward initiative, as highlighted by the Executive Director, represents a comprehensive roadmap to build a stronger ITC, tackling prohibited conduct and fostering a better workplace culture. This is vital to ensure that the ITC continues to be an agile, responsive, and fit for purpose channel to deliver the SDGs through global trade.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 22.9-->
                <p>
                    <t>To summarize the discussions at the Joint Advisory Group meeting, Ambassador Theodore pointed to three main takeaways: First, there was a recognition that, despite the challenging trade and aid environment, the ITC continues to deliver at the top of its game, delivering on its core mission of ensuring the competitiveness of small businesses while adapting its offerings to address global challenges. Second, it is important for the ITC to scale up its successful approaches so that thousands more small businesses in developing countries are supported to grow and thrive sustainably. For this, there was a call for donors to keep financing the ITC's work at the intersection of trade and development. Third, it was clear that partnerships are vital for jointly addressing challenges, leveraging strengths, and maximizing impact. Whether in Geneva or in cooperation with private sector partners, NGOs, and foundations across the world, ITC is committed to working with partners to meet the needs of small businesses.</t>

Our own trade partnerships programme – UKTP – with the ITC, helps us in the UK to understand what businesses need in order to take full advantage of our own, more generous, preferences scheme - the developing countries trading scheme.

                                <t>China is pleased to see that the 57th Session of Joint Advisory Group of ITC/UNCTAD/WTO was successfully held. And we commend ITC's efforts on supporting MSMEs growth and helping developing members achieve economic recovery. China cherishes the cooperative relationship with ITC. Since the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) held in 2018, ITC has organized 325 MSMEs from more than 30 members to participate in the event. Their participation has generated businesses of around 65 million US dollars in total.</t>

                                <t>Furthermore, ITC and WTO collaboration on trade has been very fruitful for development and inclusiveness purposes. For example, ITC help businesses like MSMEs understand, adapt to and benefit from trade rules. It also contributes to the topic of women empowerment by implementing programs facilitating women entrepreneurs. It collaborates with WTO on trade facilitation, in particular through the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility. Its work on Investment Facilitation for Development is very solid. By implementing "Fostering Knowledge and A Common Understanding on Investment Facilitation Project", the ITC strengthens the capacity of developing and least developed members of participating in the WTO negotiations on IFD Agreement through a series of regional seminars and workshops, and also supports members conducting investment facilitation self-assessment through experience sharing. Next year, ITC will celebrate its 60th anniversary. China looks forward to deepening the cooperation with ITC and its work with the WTO.</t>

In this regard, we are working very successfully with the ITC in the Central Asian region within the framework of the EU funded project, ready for trade in Central Asia and with strong emphasis on women who are engaged in e-commerce. The ITC is providing capacity building within that framework, as well as helping these businesses to get financing as well as implement their projects. So, this is an opportunity when I can also call on Members to support the ITC because the ITC receives financing from international organizations, as well as from bilateral donors. With the support of Members and bilateral donors, the ITC will be able to do more in order to make difference, particularly for MSMEs and women in trade.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson took up the reports listed under item 23, which had been prepared in line with the Decision concerning Procedures for an Annual Overview of WTO Activities and for Reporting under the WTO (WT/L/105). Delegations had already had substantive discussions on these reports in the respective bodies where they had already been adopted, and therefore the Chairperson suggested not to repeat those discussions in the General Council. She also noted that, in line with the reporting obligations, reports from the respective bodies would be forwarded to the Ministerial Conference. She proposed that, in accordance with practice, the General Council took action on these reports. She therefore invited the General Council to adopt the report of the Committee on Trade and Development in document WT/COMTD/103, and to take note of the reports of the other WTO bodies, including the reports of the Committees under the Plurilateral Trade Agreements, listed in the Proposed Agenda.</t>

                    <t>The Chairperson then proposed that the General Council adopt the draft Report of the General Council contained in document WT/GC/W/907, on the understanding that the Secretariat would make the necessary adjustments to that Report to include matters that have been considered at this meeting. The Annual Report of the General Council would then be forwarded to the Ministerial Conference.</t>

                <p>
                    <t>The Chairperson recalled that the relevant Guidelines provided that the outgoing General Council Chairperson would conduct consultations on the Appointment of Chairpersons to the WTO Bodies in Groups 1, 2, 4 and 5 of its Annex. Given the busy period ahead, she noted that she had initiated this process already on 6 November. In accordance with the Guidelines, she had been assisted in this process by Ambassador Petter Ølberg (Norway), Chairperson of the Dispute Settlement Body, and Ambassador Dacio Castillo (Honduras), former Chairperson of the General Council. A list of past Chairpersons of major bodies was made available to delegations at this meeting. The Chairperson said that, in accordance with the Guidelines, representatives of Members in financial arrears for over one full year could not be considered for appointment.</t>

                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 24.2-->
                <p>
                    <t>The Chairperson informed Members that she had first met on 9 November with the four group coordinators – (i) Africa, (ii) Asia and the Pacific; (iii) Latin America and the Caribbean, and (iv) developed countries. As announced in her communication on 9 November, she had requested group coordinators to communicate their expressions of interest by 6 December. She had met group coordinators again on Friday, 8 December, and was pleased to note that there was an emerging draft slate of names.</t>
                </p>
                <!--OPENING, PARAGRAPH 24.3-->
                <p>
                    <t>She said her intention was to send a communication to all Members before the end-of-year break containing the draft slate of names with a view to preparing the ground for an informal General Council meeting in the New Year to finalize the slate of names as early as possible in 2024. She added that this way, Members were on track to complete the shared objective of finalizing the crucially important housekeeping function and, in doing so, ensure a smooth conduct of WTO bodies in 2024.</t>

As a result of this payment, Yemen, which was previously in Category III, is still subject to Administrative Measures but now in Category II. I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage other Members under Category III to make use of the possibility of initiating consultations towards the establishment of a payment plan, if that is helpful to them in meeting their obligations.</t>
