Given the extensive discussions on Tuesday, she said that she did not expect a discussion under this item. She invited the Director-General, as Chairperson of the Trade Negotiations Committee, to say a few words.</t>                </p>            </opening>            <!--STATEMENT SECTION-->            <statements>                <!--STATEMENT INFO-->                <statement_info>                    <statement_number>1.2</statement_number>                    <statement>The Director-General and Chairperson of the Trade Negotiations Committee delivered the following statement:</statement>                </statement_info>                <!--STATEMENT CONTENT-->                <statement_content>                    <!--STATEMENT PARAGRAPH 1.3-->                    <paragraph id="1.3">                        <content>                            <p>                                <t>I do not wish to say anything because we just had the TNC. The only reason I asked for the floor is to celebrate again those Members who recently ratified the Fishery Subsidies Agreement. Yesterday, we heard from the UK that they not only ratified but contributed an unexpected GBP 1,000,000 to the Fishery Subsidies Fund, which is fantastic. In addition, Chile ratified, Gambia ratified. Now we just got news that Barbados is on the verge of ratifying. This was news this morning from the Ambassador who stayed up until 2 a.m. to try to push and give us news. I want to recognize that effort and thank them most sincerely and celebrate them. I am looking for more, especially over the holiday. When we come back, I expect a lot of good news.</t>                            </p>                        </content>                    </paragraph>                    <!--STATEMENT PARAGRAPH 1.4-->                    <paragraph id="1.4">                        <content>                            <p>                                <t>The General Council took note of the statement.</t>                            </p>                        </content>                    </paragraph>                </statement_content>            </statements>        </agenda> </body></document>
